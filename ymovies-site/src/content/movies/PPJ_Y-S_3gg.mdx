Reviews:<br />
"Robbery under Arms is very entertaining, has plenty of action, involving interesting characters, fascinating backgrounds and (after a beginning that is a little, just a little on the slow side) moves with suspenseful rapidity. Production values are unstinting and technical credits highly proficient. Jack Lee is not exactly a highly imaginative director but his staging for the most part is skilful and highly competent. He has drawn realistic performances from his players, made impressive use of his locations, and knitted such other elements as photography, music, costumes and sets into a satisfying whole."<br />
