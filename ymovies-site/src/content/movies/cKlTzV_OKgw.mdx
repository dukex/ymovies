Story:
Outlaws attack a band of settlers and kill everyone except a pregnant woman who's rescued by a band of Indians. The woman dies giving birth but Chief White Bear adopts her male baby, naming him "Shining Sky," and raising him as brother to his own son, Black Wolf. The boys grow up together and good-naturedly compete for the affections of pretty Rising Star. In a competition, Shining Sky accidentally kills Black Wolf, is forced from the tribe, and finds work in a nearby town where he pretends to be a mute. A townswoman named Isabella flirts with him but when he spurns her she yells "Rape!" Bart Ryder, henchman of the local "Colonel," runs Shining Sky out of town, hangs him by the wrists, and leaves him to die. Crazy Bull rescues Shining Sky and takes him back to the Indian village where he's reunited with Rising Star. Ryder, however, seeks to finish the job of killing the "White Apache."

Review:
"Apache Kid opens with a murderous attack by Southern renegades on a Mormon wagon train; the Mormons had already made friendship with the Indians, and all men, women and children, red or white, are killed, except for one woman, who is saved by a group of Apaches arriving in the last minute (1). She dies while giving birth to a son, who is adopted by the chief and raised as if he were his own flesh and blood. Because of his pale blond hair the boy is called Shining Sky. The chief's own son, Black Wolf, and Shining Sky grow up together, and eventually become inseparable, but then a beautiful young squaw comes between them, the long-legged, sharp-nosed Rising Sun. When Black Wolf is accidently killed during a game that got out of hand, Shining Sky is forced to leave the tribe and sent to the world of the white people. He's hired by a friendly horse trailer, but also encounters a group of cutthroats who plan to annihilate the Indians because they are "in the way of progress".


When it was released theatrically, the film makers pretended it was a fateful adaptation of historic events. Most likely Apache Kid is (very) loosely based on the historic character called Apache Kid, a white kid captured by Indians at a very young age, who became a street orphan in army camps after being freed by the US army. The character of the sympathetic horse trainer seems based on Al Sieber, the Chief of Army scouts who more or less adopted the kid (2).


Sebastian Harrison is the son of muscle man (and star of many a peplum and spaghetti western) Richard Harrison. Both men would also be involved in the writing of the twin movie Scalps, but have no active part in the production of it (Richard Harrison couldn't finance it and then sold his rights). Scalps is the better of the two movies, mainly because it has a more engaging story. The storyline of Apache kid is simple, and yet the script often feels disjointed; soap opera scenes of two boys growing up together and romantic interludes in David Hamilton style are alternated with scenes of excessive slaughter and torture. It feels more like an exploitation movie than a spaghetti western; it's not excessively gory, but a pregnant Mormon woman is kicked in the groin, the kid's left arm is broken by repeated kicks and Rising Star is beaten up severely by several men and subsequently shot to pieces. All in close up. The ending is downright confusing." Written by Simon Gelten via spaghetti-western.net
