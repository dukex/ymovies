Reviews:<br />
"Sexy showgirl Lola Colt fights off the advances of the evil El Diablo, while plotting with handsome medical student Peter Martell to free the town and a group of hostages from his clutches.<br />
<br />
An Italian western with a black female protagonist (!), this vehicle for pop-star Lola Falana is a bit more entertaining than it seems like it would be. It's a little contrived, though fairly earnest and surprisingly straight-faced, playing more like a nineteen-forties B-picture than a nineteen-sixties spaghetti western, at least until Lola straps on some six-shooters for a violent climax. A compact running time helps too.<br />
<br />
An interracial romance between Lola and Martell, as well as a kiss between Lola and El Diablo appear to have been scrubbed from the English language version." Written by FightingWesterner on IMDb.com <br />
<br />
"Lola Colt" was made during the height of the spaghetti western craze in Italy, though it only got theatrically released in the United States nine years later, where it was marketed as a blaxploitation flick. I am sure that African Americans who went to see this movie were disappointed. To be sure, actress Lola Falana looks both pretty and comfortable in her surroundings. Also, there is refreshingly no reference to her race at any point in the movie (though this fact may make much of this movie hard to swallow to some in the audience.) However, Falana isn't given much to do for the most part. In fact, she more or less becomes a supporting character instead of a true lead character. She eventually straps on some guns for the climax, a climax that gives the movie some much needed action after being so talky and uneventful before then. And after the climax, the movie comes to a near halt again, and we have to wait a considerable amount of time before the movie finally comes to an end. Die hard fans of spaghetti westerns might find a little interest in this movie both for its unusual set-up and how it pretty much completely botches this set-up. For others, well, there are a lot better spaghetti westerns out there." Written by Wizard-8 on IMDb.com <br />
