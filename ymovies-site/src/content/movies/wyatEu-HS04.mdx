American Western starring Sterling Hayden: Kansas Pacific - With the Civil War about to begin, Southern saboteurs attack frontier railroad construction.<br />
<br />
Kansas Pacific (1953)<br />
Director: Ray Nazarro<br />
Writer: Daniel B. Ullman (adapted from his play)<br />
Stars: Sterling Hayden, Eve Miller, Barton MacLane<br />
Genre: Western <br />
Country of origin: United States<br />
Language: English<br />
Also known as: L'assalto al Kansas Pacific<br />
Filming locations: Iverson Ranch - 1 Iverson Lane, Chatsworth, Los Angeles, California, USA<br />
<br />
Storyline:<br />
Just before the Civil War (but after the South has seceded), Southern saboteurs try to prevent railroad construction from crossing Kansas to the frontier; army captain Nelson is sent out to oppose them. As the tracks push westward, Nelson must contend with increasingly violent sabotage, while trying to romance the foreman's pretty daughter Barbara.<br />
<br />
Reviews:<br />
"I can't recall Clayton Moore as anyone but the "brave masked man," but here he is as a bad guy with no mask. I'd say that counts as irony.<br />
<br />
Also: who ever heard of a main character named "Mr. Bruce" in the Westerns. I think I know the source of the name, as my dad wrote the script. The same goes for the daughter, Barbara. If they had a daughter, my folks planned to name her Barbara. Three years later, they did and my sister's name is Barbara.<br />
<br />
The memorable quotes struck a chord with me, especially when Mr. Bruce says that no one pushes him around -- except his daughter and his wife. Such dry humor was a hallmark of my father and I miss it and, of course, him." Written by BruceUllm on IMDb.com <br />
<br />
"I saw "Kansas Pacific" in theatrical release, as the second half of a double bill with "War of the Worlds". What a day at the movies that was! Since then, I've sought this film out and have seen it repeatedly. There could be more rail action for my taste, but what there is, plus the solid performances of the fine cast, makes for a very good Western indeed. And Albert Sendrey's terrific gonna-build-a-railroad soundtrack music is epic. I've always wished Hollywood had given him more to do. You'll be humming that theme, and carrying fond memories of steaming down the high iron aboard the "Kansas Pacific". Highly recommended to all." Written by Hup234! on IMDb.com<br />
