Storyline:
The mayor has sent for a gunslinger who, though appearing to clean up the town, is really to be the mayor's means of taking the town over. When Roy and Gabby arrive in Tombstone, Roy is mistaken for the gunslinger. Just as Roy is ready to expose the mayor, the real gunslinger shows up. Written by Ed Stephan on IMDb.com

Reviews:
In so many of his movies, Roy Rogers played a character named Roy Rogers. In "Sheriff of Tombstone," though, he is Brett Starr, a refreshing change and another opportunity for Roy Rogers to show he had more than one dimension.

Though fans usually didn't need anything other than Roy, "Sheriff of Tombstone" also had unusually good dialogue and a good story, by James Webb (not the current U.S. Senator, although he too is a good writer), with a good screenplay by Olive Cooper.

There is a remarkably good cast, with everyone's favorite sidekick, George "Gabby" Hayes, who was actually a fine actor, capable of many types of character.

Harry Woods gets one of his biggest roles, and shows some dimensions too, giving one of his best performances.

Jay Novello, almost completely unknown today except to us western fans, also shows a surprising ability at characterization. You really have to see this performance to believe it.

Adorable Sally Payne plays a character who is both an eccentric personality and a charming singer, a great role for her and a great chance for us to see her ability.

Songs, for her and for Roy, come from the great Bob Nolan as well as Sol Meyer and Peter Tinturin, neither of whom I am familiar with, no doubt my loss.

Music in Roy Rogers movies is usually rather pedestrian, but the songs here are memorable.

The great Joe Kane is both director and associate producer, and his touch helps make this a superb B western.

Republic might not have spent a lot of money, but there is a lot of talent and effort in this excellent movie. Written by morrisonhimself on IMDb.com
