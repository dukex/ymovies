Storyline:<br />
A drifter returns to a small town to avenge the murder of his wife and daughter.<br />
<br />
Reviews:<br />
"This is a solid spaghetti western that has a great cast and lots of cool Euro-western style.<br />
<br />
The music is very good. Some parts of the score are very minimalist, using only a single guitar. A couple of other parts sound kind of creepy, almost like they are using a theremin. All of it sounds very appropriate for a spaghetti western. It also has a great typical spaghetti-style opening theme.<br />
<br />
Anthony Steffen does a fine job as the revenge seeking stranger Gary Hamilton. Anyone who thinks his unemotional performance in "Django the Bastard" (aka "Stranger's Gundown") was unintentional should see this movie, because here he proves that he can show feelings if the part requires it. Eduardo Fajardo is great as the scumbag town boss Acombar. Here he plays a character that is more over-the-top than his usually more refined villainous roles. I love the part where he tells his men to bring him Gary Hamilton's head because he wants to see it on a pole.<br />
<br />
What is it with these names? In Antonio Margheriti's "And God Said to Cain," there is also a man named Gary Hamilton seeking revenge against a man named Acombar, though the story and characters are completely different. I'd love to know the story behind this. It doesn't seem like something that would be mere coincidence.<br />
<br />
Another interesting thing about this movie is that it makes no bones about being an Italian western. Pepe Calvo (as the water salesman) speaks with an obvious accent, as does the beautiful Adriana Ambesi (as Rosy). Ambesi also sings a song in Italian in the saloon. This adds a nice touch to the film. It's also refreshing to see a Euro-western that doesn't make a vain attempt to hide its origins.<br />
<br />
This is a cool movie for people whose interest in spaghetti westerns goes beyond just liking the Leone/Eastwood movies." Written by spider89119 on IMDb.com.<br />
