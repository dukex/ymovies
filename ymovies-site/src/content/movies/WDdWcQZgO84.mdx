Reviews:<br />
"Highly entertaining and influential Western about a large wagon train that starts off in the Midwest and plans to head out West and up into Oregon. Along the way there are various internal battles as well as dangerous issues with Indians as well as other problems with their journey.<br />
<br />
One could watch THE COVERED WAGON today and say that it doesn't have anything original to it but they would be missing the point. This was a very original movie when it was originally released and it has been copied so many times since 1923 that some people might forget or just overlook the fact that the rules were formed here for all future Westerns. There are certainly some flaws in the film but at the same time there's no question that this is a highly entertaining movie and one that works on many levels.<br />
<br />
As I said, the film is basically about this large wagon train heading out West and we see the various problems that happen on the journey. This includes a love triangle between the three main characters. You've got the good guy Will (J. Warren Kerrigan), the bad guy Sam (Alan Hale) and then there's Molly (Lois Wilson) who both want. This leads to some very fun scenes including an extended fight sequence that was perfectly directed by James Cruze. You've also got some other great action including a river crossing, a buffalo hunt and a sequence where the wagons are attacked by Indians.<br />
<br />
There are some flaws with the film including Kerrigan not being that strong as the lead. I thought he gave a fine performance and I thought he was good to watch but at the same time I think the film would have benefited from a stronger lead. Hale was wonderful as the villain and Wilson was cute enough for what she was asked to do. The film featured some very good cinematography and I'd also argue that the editing itself was good. The locations were great and while the story itself wasn't the strongest, it was at least good enough to hold your attention throughout.<br />
<br />
THE COVERED WAGON is certainly a landmark Western and one that influenced everything that was to follow. The movie isn't perfect but it's about as entertaining as you can get."-Written by Michael_Elliott on IMDb.com<br />
