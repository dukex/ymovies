Synopsis:<br />
Guy Madison has a high old time as a would be feudal baron in the Wild West. No one is willing to stand up to Madison and his henchmen, no one that is, except mild-mannered inventor Tom Bosley. It seems that Bosley has welded together a robot gunslinger, whom he calls “The Bang Bang Kid”. Only trouble is, the “Kid” breaks down at the darnedest times. The film goes off in too many directions, but generally delivers the goods laugh-wise.<br />
<br />
Reviews:<br />
Tom Bosley pulls off a surprisingly funny performance in this odd-ball Italian western tale. Some camp, a good-looking girl, a handsome guy and some baddies. Oh yes, an overweight robot Sheriff!<br />
<br />
My favorite quote - "In the hands of a woman, even a broken machine can do better than a man."<br />
<br />
See it for fun - you'll be afraid at first that it will become a bore-fest but it really is charming.<br />
