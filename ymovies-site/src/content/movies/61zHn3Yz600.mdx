<br />
Review:<br />
Running from the law, and again<br />
Wells Fargo complain about lack of security for their transports. They hire special agents (read: bounty hunters) to find the most dangerous man around, Glenn Kovacs, dead or alive. One of these agents is Jeff Sullivan, who starts his investigation by buying the freedom of Dan Barker, a prisoner who might lead him to Kovacs. Barker isn't exactly grateful for his liberation - he escapes from Sullivan at the first opportunity. Out of the frying pan, into the fire: soon he is chased by the other bounty hunters, too - including the brutal Corrales who tortures him with barbed wire. Nevertheless Barker, meanwhile accompanied by the lovely Susan, gets to Kovacs, and they prepare for battle...<br />
<br />
Well, you get everything you expect: the guns, the dust, the beards and a lively soundtrack by Bruno Nicolai. Craig Hill plays Jeff Sullivan, the usual Clint Eastwood type of hero. Angel Aranda as Barker is a bandit with character development - hateful at the beginning, he is tamed somewhat by Susan. Fernando Sancho as Corrales is - rarely enough in his movies - on the right side of the law, even he has a very generous interpretation of the "carte blanche" given to him by Wells Fargo. It's hard to distinguish between the good guys and the bad guys, everything is pretty much a competition for a lot of dollars, quite common in the genre, but well executed here, except that the main villain appears only after more than an hour of the movie, so that the story occasionally feels a little stretched up to then. All in all, an enjoyable flick. My vote: 6/10. Written by unbrokenmetal on imdb.com<br />
