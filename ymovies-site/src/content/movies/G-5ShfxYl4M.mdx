"In the Arizona Territory in 1879, Captain Jeff Stanton takes command of a cavalry unit tasked with returning the Apaches to their reservation. The Mescaleros Apaches, led by chief Victorio, have left the reservation and openly attacked farmers,gold miners and settlers who trespassed on their lands. During a skirmish, Captain Stanton captures Red Hawk, the son of the chief, and uses him to bargain for a truce.Stanton promises to chief Victorio to see that gold miners and settlers are kept off Indian lands.However, some greedy townsfolk and disfranchised gold miners plot to break the uneasy truce.They murder the Indian agent and blame the Apaches.They complain to Washington D.C. about Captain Stanton's negotiated truce.Stanton is replaced by Colonel Perry who intends to use a heavy hand in subduing the Apaches.The consequence of this strategy change proves disastrous."

Review:
"Once again the story of an officer who makes a peace treaty with the Indians, which ends up not being respected. The story is well told, with Murphy, Linda Lawson and specially Michael Dante giving very good performances. This probably was one of the last conventional westerns, because in 1964 there were plenty of spaghetti westerns, also German westerns and westerns made in Spain, also those trying to destroy the myth of the west were beginning to come out. The fact is that less people were willing to go to a cinema to see this type of film, and they were too expensive to be made only for TV. Perhaps if the market for video stores would exist at the time, they would have kept on being made, which would have been great because they were quite entertaining." Written by tmwest on IMDb.com
