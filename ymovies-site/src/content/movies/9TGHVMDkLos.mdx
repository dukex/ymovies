Story:<br />
Rick Thorne, a circuit judge, rides into Bannerman and discovers everything in town is controlled by rich rancher Josiah Bannerman and his kin. He meets sheriff Nat Bell and district attorney Buck Streeter and asks why Bannerman's arrogant son, Tom, got away with killing a man without an arrest or trial.<br />
<br />
Offered no assistance, Thorne stands up to Tom and then jails him. He becomes acquainted with Bannerman's beautiful niece, Amy Lee, who is attracted to Thorne but doubts her cousin Tom is a cold-blooded killer.<br />
<br />
Thorne finds allies in Caroline and Vince Webb, who own a gun shop and are willing to testify with evidence against Tom in court. Thorne realizes he needs to sneak Tom and the Webbs to a different town if he's to get a fair trial. Bannerman and his men pursue them, and Amy Lee watches as Tom deliberately causes Vince Webb's death. In time, Thorne gets the prisoner to the next town safely, and Amy Lee goes to court to back him up.<br />

Review:<br />
Good traditional McCrea Western<br />
Traditional Western done well. Good script with echos of High Noon. Good direction by Tourneur. Well rounded characters fleshed out by familiar 50's actors.<br />
<br />
Early Kevin McCarthy, does well in a supporting role. Different type of role for John McEntire, who usually plays decent upstanding characters. As expected, role perfect for Western actor Joel McCrea. The ending sets up as a bit of a surprise but it turns out to be perfectly set up. This is good film for western film buffs.<br />
<br />
Only drawback is print's color pallet bit washed out and red tinted. But most would give that a pass as movie stands out as a good 50's western. Written by zorg1952 on imdb.com<br />
