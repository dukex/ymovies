Reviews:
"This is a great early Euro western with all of the usual elements an Italian western; revenge, gold, beautiful women , dusty scenes and an Ennio Morricone score, as regards the music. I won't give away the plot! There's also the usual staged -and perhaps pointless fistfights - and some humour. Definitely worth a watch for fans of the genre, if you can find a copy. Hardly the greatest in the genre, but worthwhile nonetheless."
