Storyline:<br />
After 10 years in prison, a man who was betrayed by his ex-lover and framed-up by his ex-partner seeks vengeance despite the fact that his former partner, now rich and influential, employs a small army of henchmen. Former Confederate officer Gary Hamilton has served 10 years in a hard-labor prison for a robbery that took place in the final days of the Civil War. A transport of Confederate gold was robbed by Acombar who then left Gary Hamilton's water-flask at the scene, in an effort to incriminate him. However, Gary Hamilton had an alibi as he was at his girlfriend's house that day. Nevertheless, during the trial, his girlfriend, Maria, corrupted by Acombar's promises of money, lied and said that she was alone that day. Gary Hamilton ended up in prison for 10 years while Acombar ended up with the loot and the girl. Maria married Acombar. Released from prison, Gary Hamilton returns to the town where Acombar and Maria now live. He plans to exact revenge but Acombar is surrounded by an army of bodyguards. Informed about Hamilton's return into town, Acombar instructs his men to wait in ambush and kill Hamilton. The odds are against Hamilton but at least he can take advantage of the secret network of underground tunnels running under the town. The tunnels are part of an ancient Indian burial site. The final showdown comes at dusk, during a terrible wind storm.<br />

Reviews:<br />
"Quite wonderful, doom laden, totally focused, Gothic horror, spaghetti western, extraordinaire. The revenge story is as simple as could be and indeed is more or less told to us in seconds three quarters the way through the film, but the manner of the telling with the oncoming storm and the tolling bells, and the matter of the lead actor. Sometimes Klaus Kinski disappoints because you expect so much from him and it is sad when for one reason or another, bad dubbing, bad direction or simply lazy Kinski, things don't quite come together. Well, they do here and my only hesitation in recommending this wholeheartedly to everyone is that not everyone enjoys spaghetti westerns and for those that do, this is certainly not a typical example. Still, if you fancy a real treat this is engaging from the very beginning, with all the bleakness of the chain gang and their rock breaking, to the sensational finale complete with a great Lady of Shanghai multiple mirror effect and general conflagration. Immaculate, but do find a decent print!" Written by christopher_underwood on IMDb.com.<br />

"Klaus Kinski (once again) delivers an excellent performance in the lead, and although the role of Gary Hamilton is unusual for Kinski, I could hardly imagine anybody else to fit in this role as perfectly as he does. Peter Carsten also does a very good job as the villainous Acombar, and the supporting cast contains Gino Lollobrigida." Written by Witchfinder-General-666 on IMDb.com.<br />
