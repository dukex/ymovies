Story:
Jesse James, retired and living under an assumed name in St. Joseph, Missouri, agrees over the protests of his wife Zee to join Bob Ford and Sam Wells in a Colorado gold raid. Jesse rounds up gunman Arch Clements; demolition expert Elias Hobbs, with suspect credentials as he later blows himself up; and get-away wagon driver Johnny Jorette. They rendezvous at Ford's saloon in Creede, Colorado, where Ford's girlfriend Kate joins the gang. Sam guesses Ford's plan to double-cross Jesse and collect a reward and Ford kills him. Lots of other people die before Jesse and Ford ride off in opposite directions. This was made shortly after Tom Neal, in real life, nearly killed Franchot Tone in a fight over Miss Payton, so when she sings (unless she was dubbed) "That's the Man for Me" in this film, it appears to be heartfelt.

Review:
Really good surprise
I did not expect such a good western , one more speaking of Jesse James, and there were batches, believe me. This one directed by Reginald Le Borg is fast paced, very strongly acted, with great conviction. The characters are powerful for such a B movie. It is not the Niicholas Ray, Henry King, Phil Kaufman nor the Walter Hill's versions but still fairly good. From director Reginald Le Borg, I would prefer THE DALTON GIRLS, but that's my own opinion. This western is full of charm and charisma. Excellent photography too and camera work. Reginald Le borg was a very eclectic film maker: horror, adventures, westerns but he was mostly known in the USA for the Joe Palooka films, at least some of them. His biggest gross, but that doesn't mean that audiences knew his name either.... Joe Palooka's audiences were not the kind to care about the film director's names.... And in this western, Jesse James doesn't meet Bill Cody, Billy the Kid, Geronimo, Juarez or Pancho Villa, as in so many stupid other westerns. But the main thing to explain before the viewing is that it's useless to wait for the umpteenth story of the Northfield Minnesota raid and it's where abouts - this one is totally invented - nor the final scene with Bob Ford and Jesse James fixing a picture in his living room.... Actually this story could have been made for any kind of character, and so why Jesse James? That's the question, but that doesn't remove any interest to this effective yarn.
