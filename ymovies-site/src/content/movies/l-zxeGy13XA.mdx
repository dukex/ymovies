Storyline:
Indian scout Jim Read is picked by his commander to set up a meeting between Comanche Chief Quanah Parker and a representative from Washington to negotiate a peace treaty. People from the Comanche tribe as well as the US Calvary have reason to prevent the meeting from ever taking place. Romance, betrayal and fighting ensue.

Reviews:
"A decent western that might on the surface look routine with its cavalry vs Comanche story, however, there are some fresh touches such as when after the Indian attack on the Mexican village a curve ball is thrown when it's revealed that the Comanches are somewhat justified in their attack, plus Dana's character is the cousin of Quannah Parker. And though the action is lacking, the ending is quite tense when Quannah and his natives appear on the mountain, their vocalisation sounding eerie. Of course, what follows is a well structured action sequence.

The performances from the actors are good, but it's Harry Brandon as Black Cloud who steals the scene with his snarl. The dialogue is also intelligent, especially between Dana's character and Quannah." -Written by "coltras35" on IMDb.com
