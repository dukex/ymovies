<br />
Reviews:<br />
"Royals' Revenge is a classic tale of payback and redemption, in a dirty and lowdown manner that you would expect from 1800s dusty, trail wary cowboys and cowgirls. With a few twists and turns along the way, you will be kept guessing at what will happen next. I think it's way better than the rating it has gotten so far, 5.7 at the time of my review, and I'm a big fan of westerns. The story is heavy on character development, and the cast performed beautifully. To be honest, I had never heard of any of the actors, but I'll be watching for them in the future. If there ever was a movie to support the old expression, "blood is thicker than water", this is it!"<br />
