Reviews:<br />
"I came upon this little old Western because I like Sam Elliot in just about anything I see. I think he is a fine actor, underrated by many as just a one character actor. This early one proves them wrong. I thought that this movie had an early tone of the current independent movies being made. Also a little of a European quality to the way it was presented. Quiet, not a lot of background music. Sometimes seemingly slow, but well paced and always going somewhere. Sam Elliot's character of Johnny, was wonderfully played. We don't know him in the beginning, only his reputation. He reveals himself verbally at first, and by his actions as the movie progresses. Vera Miles as Molly, was so touching. A woman self described as once bright and fun when she was young, now afraid to speak. Her hopes and dreams gone with the dust of the town and aging without the much wanted children. Her husband, Marvin is the Sheriff. Softly played by John Anderson, he shows us how hard life has made him, and later his true caring underneath. This is a great script. It is about selfishness, and selflessness; the inability to change, and the ability to change; needing protection, and the empowering chance to protect. They just used a Western set as a backdrop. I wish that this great little movie could find wider distribution now with videos. I thought it was truly well played and well made!!"<br />
