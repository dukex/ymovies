Jud McGraw gets out of prison and seeks revenge against Mimmo, a man who wronged him. He meets Little Moon, a woman who also has good reason to go looking for justice.

Mimmo pretty much owns the whole town, including the sheriff, whose sister Billie is also Mimmo's woman. A quick-draw gunslinger for hire, Kid Dandy, plays billiards and helps keep Mimmo safe from harm, at least until McGraw gets to town.
