Story:
Three Walker Brothers grew up and found themselves on different life paths; one, a ruthless criminal, another, respectable U.S. Marshal, and the last, a successful rancher/ businessman. But they all have one common ambition from the beginning: to find the men who murdered their father in front of their own eyes when they were young. And when all of them finally found the man the difference in idealogies drove them to an inevitable showdown.

Review:
Pre-spaghetti western
A good reason to watch this movie is historical interest. One year before `A Fistful of Dollars', this is not a typical spaghetti western yet. `I tre spietati' was entitled `Gunfight At High Noon' in the UK, which proves that I'm not the only one under the impression that the classic American westerns still were the source of inspiration for this respectable B-movie. `I tre spietati' tells the story of three brothers whose father was murdered 20 years ago. One of them starts a family, one reads books about law and justice, one becomes a killer. By whom of the three will the unforgotten murder be avenged? Several actors (Richard Harrison, Robert Hundar and especially Fernando Sancho who is the comical sidekick here) successfully continued in the western genre when the wave really started 2 years later.
