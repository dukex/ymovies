However, this is a delicate and challenging mission, as the pair's only clues lead them to a dusty small town where the colonel's relatives, the mighty Forrester family, have, too, set their sights on finding the gold. Now, Lord and Bull find themselves up against an entire army of cut-throats, bent on getting them out of the way. Will they make it out of this death trap alive and in one piece?"

Reviews:<br />
"The second Western from Giuliano Carnimeo is a perfect production with a great cast. George Hilton and Walter Barnes are a perfect team and on the other side the great german actor Horst Frank. As Regina Loni von Friedl is also very good and insidious. Responsible for the good looking of the movie is Stelvio Massi with his camerawork. The movie has also a ironic sense of humor which is very good for it. Francesco de Masi did a great job with the wunderfull music. Giuliano Carnimeo and George Hilton made also a few other good movies together f.ex. the Giallo "Perché quelle strane gocce di sangue sul corpo di Jennifer?" or the western- comedy " Il West ti va stretto, amico ... è arrivato Alleluja". Carnimeo is also responsible for three of the Sartana- movies with Gianni Garko." Written by garko80 on IMDb.com <br />

"The DVD company Wild East put this out with another George Hilton spaghetti western on the same disc, "Full House For The Devil". The two compliment each other, and not in a good way. This is a pretty poor western. The first third of the movie is very confusing, with motivations by the various characters murky. Eventually we learn what's going on, but the movie doesn't really improve with that knowledge. The story remains very slow-moving, and the sporadic action sequences are not particularly exciting. The two protagonists (played by Hilton and Walter Barnes) are not very likable, coming across as kind of smug and cold-hearted. Is there anything of merit to be found here? Well, the opening credits song is not bad, and the director occasionally pulls off an interesting visual. But I think even the biggest spaghetti western fans won't find this limited merit enough to make the movie worth investing their time with." Written by Wizard-8 on IMDb.com <br />
