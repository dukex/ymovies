Synopsis:
To scare the squatters from the cattle country he claims as his own, rancher Ed Sampson orders the Martin farm house burned. Galt Martin is killed, and his eldest son, Joe, is pistol-whipped. Timmy Martin sees the killer, Cass Becker and points him out when he and Joe are in Painted Flats. Cass forces Joe to put on a gun but Ned East, a retired gunfighter, saves the inexperienced Joe by forcing Cass to draw on him, and Ned is the winner. Sampson sends for a fast gun, Clint Jones, to take care of the squatters. He also sends three of his henchmen to intercept a stagecoach bringing three mail-order brides; Kathie for Joe Martin, Mary for Ned East and Ella for Andy Heather. Clint is also on the stage and kills the henchmen whey they hold it up. Clint also has his eyes on Joe's mail-order bride.

Reviews:
"With Plunderers Of Painted Flats, Republic Studios came to an end of an over 20 year run as a B film studio. Its bread and butter were the westerns that you now found on the small screen. A medium that had Republic's president Herbert J. Yates embraced, Republic might still be in the western business.

But if not with a classic western Republic went out with a good one with some unusual themes like wedding night jitters which you'd never see in one of Roy and Dale's films.

George MacReady is at his most malevolent here, a large Ponderosa ranch owner who wants to get larger. He has no scruples whatever chasing whom he deems squatters off his land. One of his gang shoots down the father of Skip Homeier and little Ricky Allen and then an old gunfighter played Edmund Lowe shoots down the gang member of MacReady who did the deed.

That's when MacReady decides some really specialized help is needed so he sends for another gunfighter John Carroll who is like a malevolent version of Shane. On the same stagecoach that Carroll are three mail order brides, Madge Kennedy, Bea Benedaret, and Corinne Calvet and Calvet is intended for Skip Homeier and she's a woman who's been around and Homeier hasn't.

Those are the plot ingredients and even given the cheapness of production I have to say the story is well acted and well told. Carroll gives one of his best screen performances, sadly enough in a neglected western.

I have to say that Herbert J. Yates did end his studio's output with a good one. Definitely catch this one if broadcast."
