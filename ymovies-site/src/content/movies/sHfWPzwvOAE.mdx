Full Western Movie, Full Length Cowboy Film, English: (1967) "Vado... l'ammazzo e torno" (original title), Runtime 1h 45min, Action, Adventure, Western.<br />
<br />
Any Gun Can Play (Italian: Vado... l'ammazzo e torno) is a 1967 spaghetti western starring Gilbert Roland, Edd Byrnes and George Hilton. The film is directed by Enzo G. Castellari and features a score by Francesco De Masi and Alessandro Alessandroni. It follows a familiar pattern of protagonists searching for gold, double-crossing one another and a high body count. The three main characters continually change allegiances and get the upper hand only to be thwarted by fellow outlaws, mysterious insurance investigators and each other.<br />
<br />
In the opening scene one of the three outlaws is dressed very similar to Clint Eastwood's character in the "Dollars" trilogy, one is dressed as Lee Van Cleef's characters in those and other westerns, and one as Franco Nero's character Django.<br />
<br />
A gang robs a gold shipment from a train. A so called bounty hunter is sent to track down the robbers and decides to let them lead him to the gold.<br />
