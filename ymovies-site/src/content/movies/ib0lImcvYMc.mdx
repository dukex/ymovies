Storyline:
Jeptha Marr has built the town of Pawnee, Kansas, and established a successful freight company. He sees his fortunes at risk due to the encroachment of a new railroad, spearheaded by Stephen Bent. Marr sends his right-hand man Gideon Skene to disrupt Bent's activities. Bent takes an unusual tack in dealing with Marr's opposition: he woos Marr's daughter Vinnie. But the unscrupulous forces of a third opposing figure, the ruthless Champ Clanton, create an uneasy alliance between Bent and Marr.

Reviews:
"This was rather an anomaly among 'B' Westerns, the nominal bad guy Stephen Bent (Richard Dix) conducted himself rather admirably, while the loyal foreman of the Jeptha Marr Freighting Company, Gideon Skene (Albert Dekker), often looked like a vigilante. The REAL outlaw of course was Champ Clanton, portrayed by the ever capable Victor Jory in all his villainous glory. The story itself was played out rather seamlessly, no mean feat for an oater from the 1940's. So much so, that it's about the only one I've ever rated as high as a 7, and that includes virtually all of the Roy Rogers and Gene Autry flicks. It didn't hurt that there was an intriguing supporting cast that included Lee J. Cobb and Jane Wyatt, which in an unusual casting decision, called for Miss Wyatt, a year older than Cobb, to play his daughter!!! In fact, I'd have to say that Cobb's character here, Jeptha Marr, looked older than a handful of roles he performed up to as much as a decade later.

For anyone who gets a kick out of those little nuances that shed light on life in an earlier era, this film offers a few that were pretty interesting. Like when Gideon offers a dollar per man to unload his wagons at Pawnee and there were no shortage of takers. Or how about that conversation between Jane Wyatt's character and Bent on how marvelous it was that trains traveled at the unprecedented speed of twenty five miles per hour?!! Why someday, you would be able to take a train from New York City to San Francisco in less than two weeks! Can you imagine that?

Of course, it's always cool to catch Joe Sawyer in one of his tough guy roles, but for a real life tough guy, Max Baer had to be one of the best as a former World's Heavyweight Champ. He's suitably cast here as one of Gideon's good guy sidekicks named 'Tiny', getting to show off some of his dexterity in the fisticuffs department. But the surprise of the picture for me - George Reeves popping up as a railroad surveyor! You just have to love these old Westerns for the actors who turn up before they made it.

The only thing I would question regarding the story would be how easily Jeptha Marr became a pro-railroad man at the finale. Not that it couldn't have happened with a little more plot development, but earlier he wanted railroad agent Bent off his land or under it! It works well enough for the story, but just don't think about it too much."
