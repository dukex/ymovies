Story:
The plot is a mystery revolving around Captain Tom Harvey, an undercover army agent played by James Millican, who is investigating the theft of army gold shipments. During his undercover investigations, Harvey takes on the job of deputy sheriff and is drawn into discovering the source of a ghost who is terrorizing the town. The ghost is apparently the manifestation of a gambler who was wrongly convicted and hanged for the gold thefts.

Review:
Millican plays Captain Tom Harvey, who arrives in a dusty New Mexico town looking for stolen shipments of gold. Harvey, undercover as an itinerant cowpoke, confides his real mission to the sheriff (Victor Kilian) and takes a job as deputy.

Meanwhile the Abilene Kid (Reed Hadley), a suave gambler, is framed for cheating in a card game and convicted in a kangaroo court presided over by Judge Gardner (George Cleveland). In a rather shocking development, the Abilene Kid is immediately hung.

Shortly thereafter, various townspeople are murdered one by one, with a playing card left with each body

Rimfire is a gripping little western with good performances, especially by Reed Hadley as the gambler who gets framed and hung - people surrounding his death die with a card placed next to the body. Which indicates that a ghost of the gambler has done this, to exact revenge, which reminds one of High Plains Drifter. Of course, there has to be a reasonable explanation... is there? You have to watch and find out. It might have a short running time but everything is fitted neatly inside - there's a grim atmosphere and it's well-written and fairly suspenseful.
