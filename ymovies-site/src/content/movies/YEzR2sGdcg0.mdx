Story:<br />
An outlaw and a scorned husband both team up to track down and kill the man that wronged them. Along the way, the two men meet a hired gun that loves money just as much as he loves the company of women, so the two men decide to hire him in order to help them on their mission. However, things become complicated when the man they all seek to kill has risen to become a wealthy sheriff with a small army of gunmen at his disposal.<br />
<br />
Review:<br />
Two bearded men, played by Pedro Armendariz Jr. And Rogelio Guerra, learn that they are both targeting the same man for revenge, so they team up. They then convert a hired killer turned gambler / womanizer (Jorge Rivero) to their cause, and they travel to Santa Fe to eliminate their quarry (Quintin Bulnes), who's become the local sheriff!<br />
<br />
Complete with double crosses, sexy and scantily clad ladies (including Zulma Faiad as the pistoleros' prostitute girlfriend), decent widescreen photography, some hearty laughs, and a final Peckinpah-inspired bloodbath, "Guns and Guts" is generally quite fun. It *does* start out as awfully tongue-in-cheek and goofy, beginning with a series of beatings (!), then changes tone to become more serious. But it remains quite watchable for the duration.<br />
<br />
A Mexican answer to the popular "Spaghetti Western" genre, this was a credit for the prolific Mexican cult-favorite filmmaker Rene Cardona Jr., who also gave us things such as "Tintorera!", "The Bermuda Triangle", and "Treasure of the Amazon". While it's no great shakes, really, in terms of either script or direction, I did find it to be pretty entertaining, with amusing performances by all cast members concerned.<br />
