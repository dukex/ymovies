Storyline: <br />
A former sheriff, after being accused of a robbery and escaping from jail with a revolutionary bandit, seeks revenge for his brother and his family.<br />
<br />
Reviews:<br />
"Brad Harris had signed a contract for three westerns with a production company called Three Stars, but only two of the three movies were completed, Wanted Sabata and Arriva Durango, Paga o Muori. This third part (See Database Page) was produced by another company, and is said to be an assembly of re-edited scenes of the first two movies, with a couple of new scenes added (*1). The film is best know for a couple of great titles (in Italian and English) plus a wonderful poster design, also used for various releases of the movie on VHS and DVD. Biggest throwback: the scene depicted on the poster, is not in the movie.<br />
<br />
Harris is Durango (Django in some versions) and he’s a former sheriff falsely accused of a robbery. He ends up in jail with a guy called Spirito Santo, who was arrested for steeling money he needed for the revolution and his poor family at home in Mexico - at least that’s what he says (he also pretends to be one-eyed). The two are sprung out of jail by a mystery man and subsequently join a gang of Mexicans who are looking for the stolen strongbox: Durango to prove his innocence, Santo to collect money for the revolution. We also get a vengeance tale, with Durango looking for the man who killed his brother and his wife.<br />
<br />
As one might expect from an assembly movie, Death is Sweet ... doesn’t hang together. The vengeance tale is particularly stupid: Durango tracks down the killer and takes his revenge, but an earlier scene clearly showed that this man - played by Vassili Karis - was not responsible for the slayings; when he arrived on the spot, Durango’s relatives were already dead and he has been trying to eliminate Durango ever since, because he - Durango - would never believe that he was innocent. What nonsense! Is the movie worth tracking down? Harris is his usual self, steady as a rock and acting like one, but the patchwork seems to hurt Torres' performance: In Arriva Durango ... his hyperactive style worked well in combination with Harris' stoicism, but here his character has no consistency and his overzealous routines - invoking la madre de Dios every other minute or so - quickly become annoying. For completists only. But that poster is a killer." Written by Simon Gelten on spaghetti-western.net.<br />
