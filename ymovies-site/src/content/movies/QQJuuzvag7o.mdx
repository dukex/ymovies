Review:
"This movie was released in the summer before my tenth birthday. It, along with "Where the Red Fern Grows," was one of the most moving movies I saw in my pre-teens. Coincidentally, Stewart Petersen starred in both films, so it may have been a quality in his character that particularly influenced me. Coincidentally, this same actor's portrayal of the young Joseph Smith in "The First Vision," which I saw two years later during a trip through Salt Lake City, changed my life forever. "Against a Crooked Sky" evokes all the most tender emotions and inspiration of high ideals. I haven't seen it again in the almost twenty years since then, so the fact that I remember this movie is a tribute to the lasting impression it is able to leave on young viewers."

"This movie is one of my all time favorites. I have looked all over to find a copy and can't find one anywhere. Does anyone know where I could get one? It is a typical, older movie, and you won't get the cinematography you find today. However, I find that easy to overlook in this particular movie - it is so good. It catches your heartstrings and holds them throughout - and you are left emotionally spent when it's all said and done. It really leaves you looking in the mirror and evaluating.... It's a great date movie and also a wonderful family movie - you'll want to watch it more than once. Don't watch it if you don't already have the popcorn popped, it's worth your full attention." Written by Piantanida on IMDb.com.

"Against A Crooked Sky is strange viewing nowadays in that it was made before the pinheads in Hollywood decided to drastically dumb down movies aimed at children, particularly children ages ten to thirteen, reducing them to worthless comedic mind rot filled with flatulence jokes and loud flashy effects. I don't even think todays preteens would have the patience (or half of them, the Intelligence) for a movie that isn't a comedy or a fantasy!

In this, Sam Sutter watches helplessly while his sister is kidnapped by an Indian warrior. With little or no hope of recovery and all attempts to find her called off, he sets off with a drunken Richard Boone (in a fantastic performance) to find her, his only clue being a gold headband.

Although this isn't among the best westerns ever made, it's a truly entertaining outdoor adventure, the best thing about it being the developing relationship between Boone and the stubborn boy as he pushes the cantankerous old man out of his comfort zone and towards the truth about his sister's disappearance.

Against A Crooked Sky shows a strong influence of other films of the time like Little Big Man and A Man Called Horse. Like them it details strange (at least to the white man) rituals and customs, like Cut Tongue's being forced to live like a squaw and the harrowing climax, the test of the crooked sky."
