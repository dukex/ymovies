Reviews:
"Sergio Leone, the king of spaghetti westerns, would never have dreamed of making a western like "Sonny and Jed." It is a poignant film that was considered daring at the time of its release and is now labeled by many as a cult classic. Tomas Milian, who took the stage name "Tomas" after his prime role model: Tomas F. Dobb, plays Jed in an unforgettable role initially intended for Rodney Dangerfield. Susan George plays Sonny, Jed's one-true love and partner-in-crime. This is a "Bonnie and Clyde" of the west. It isn't a great film, but it seems to entertain most of the time. The best performance in the film, by far, is by Telly Savalas. He plays a blind sheriff who is determined to catch Sonny and Jed dead or alive by using any means necessary BY HIMSELF! Savalas steals every scene he is in and rightfully so. The final line in the film, "Sonny, I love you, you M**********r!", is right up there with the final line in "Gone with the Wind". Some believe it's more touching than the "Gone with the Wind" line. This is one of those hard to find films like "A Town Called Hell", "Blood and Guns", and "Villa Rides." Get it if you can."

"This movie is definitely not your average spaghetti western, and it's uniqueness is part of what makes it great.

There are really two separate stories being told in the film, and they are both given equal weight. One of them is the chasing of Jed by a revenge seeking lawman played by Telly Savalas, and the other is the dysfunctional love story of Sonny and Jed.

Franciscus, the character played by Savalas, seems out of place in a spaghetti western, wearing a long fur coat and basically being Kojak, accent and all. He even talks more like he belongs in a 1970's cop movie than a western. In one part he even calls Jed a "punk." I'm not sure, but I don't think I've ever heard that word in a spaghetti western before this one. I love when spaghetti westerns have these offbeat characters that don't belong in a western. It always makes for a cool and interesting movie. In the middle of the film, after Franciscus becomes disabled, Savalas gets to portray him as a totally different character, as his personality changes and his style of clothing becomes even more bizarre. He is truly great in this role.

Ennio Morricone's score is brilliant, and one of his more memorable. It is not the typical spaghetti western score, but it fits, and has that haunting Euro-movie style.

Definitely a must see for Euro-western fans" Written by spider89119 on IMDb.com
