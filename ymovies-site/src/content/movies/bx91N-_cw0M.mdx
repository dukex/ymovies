Along the way, he recruits a broken down, drunk prospector to help him track down the unknown tribe and rescue his sister.<br />

Review:<br />
This movie was released in the summer before my tenth birthday. It, along with "Where the Red Fern Grows," was one of the most moving movies I saw in my pre-teens. Coincidentally, Stewart Petersen starred in both films, so it may have been a quality in his character that particularly influenced me. Coincidentally, this same actor's portrayal of the young Joseph Smith in "The First Vision," which I saw two years later during a trip through Salt Lake City, changed my life forever. "Against a Crooked Sky" evokes all the most tender emotions and inspiration of high ideals. I haven't seen it again in the almost twenty years since then, so the fact that I remember this movie is a tribute to the lasting impression it is able to leave on young viewers. written by Xiaopangzi<br />
