Reviews:
"Acceptable twilight Spaghetti Western with interesting dialogue by the usual writer Ernesto Gastaldi , splendid cinematography by Zanni and memorable musical score by Nora Orlandi . It is a typical Spaghetti Western in which blends the common scenarios , as invincible and tough antiheroes , complex as well as fast showdowns with numerous casualties , impulsive and quick zooms , and musical score with Morricone influence . The picture has a certain remembrance to ¨For a fistful dollars more¨ (Sergio Leone) regarding the avenging theme and including Manuel character who bears remarkable resemblance to Indio role (Gian Maria Volonte) ; furthermore , Claudio Camaso was brother of Volonte and holding physical likeness and similar playing . Besides , good set decoration filmed in Elios studios and , of course , Almeria (Spain) . It also bears remarkable resemblance to ¨Django¨ (Sergio Corbucci) regarding 'the Saloon girl character' , equally interpreted by Loredana Nusciak . The highlights of the movie result to be the followings : when the hero wakes up from the beach along with a corpse , Django living in a photography back room studio decorated against posters captioning ¨Wanted : Dead or alive¨ , the phantom village full of dust and wind and Django buried until neck , among others . ¨Ten thousand dollars blood money¨ was shot at the same time to ¨For one hundred thousand dollars per killing (by Giovanni Fago)¨ with similar artist and technician team and also starred by Gianni Garco , Claudio Camaso and Fernando Sancho . The motion picture finely produced by Mino Loy , Luciano and Sergio Martino brothers was well directed by Romolo Guerrieri who also made other Pasta Westerns . Romolo is a good craftsman who has directed all type of genres such as post-nuke Sci-fi as ¨ The last warrior¨ , Italian crime or Poliziottesco as "Young, Violent, Dangerous" , ¨City under siege¨ , "Ring of Death" and westerns as ¨Johnny Yuma¨ and ¨Seven guns for Timothy¨ again with Fernando Sancho . Rating : Better than average Spaghetti Western ." Written by ma-cortes on IMDb.com
