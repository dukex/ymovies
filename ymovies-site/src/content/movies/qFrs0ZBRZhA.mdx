<br />
Storyline:<br />
The year is 1863. And while the Civil War rages back east, a Confederate regiment is trying to make its way through Texas to Mexico. Problem is, the Union 5th and 7th cavalry are blocking the escape route.<br />
<br />
So the Confederates, using Col. George Bonnett (Eduardo Fajardo) as an intermediary, form an alliance with Apache Chief Wild Horse.<br />
<br />
The plan is simple: Wild Horse’s warriors will attack a nearby settlement, luring the Union cavalry out of the protection of the fort. Then more Indians will attack the undermanned fort.<br />
<br />
And that strategy works to perfection, leading to the annihilation of the 5th Cavalry. Defeating the 7th with the same plan might not be as easy,<br />
<br />
The 7th has a reliable junior officer in Maj. Sam Allison (Paul Piaget). And he’s counting on an assist from reluctant Maj. Sugar Patterson (Edmund Purdom), who’s time in uniform is almost up and who would rather be drinking and womanizing than soldiering.<br />
<br />
At least until a pretty Indian girl named Amanda (Monica Randall) catches his eye. Then there’s a question of what to do with the pretty saloon singer named Nelly (Ida Galli). As harmless as she looks, could she really be a Confederate spy? Written by Mark Franklin<br />
<br />
Reviews:<br />
"Take the Civil War, add a horde of marauding Apache, two lovely ladies and a pair of large-scale cavalry vs. Indian battles, and you should be able to put together an entertaining Western.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, this film is too silly too often to be taken the least bit seriously.<br />
<br />
Take the stagecoach robbery that opens the film. A gun battle breaks out in which everyone is killed but the stage driver, the shotgun guard and two female passengers. One of the females says everyone is dead; they might as well get going. And they do, leaving the heroic male passengers lying dead in the dust with the bandits!<br />
<br />
It’s a sign of things to come. Later, the commander of the Union fort dies in a scene that must be seen to be believed. Then, during his funeral ceremony, a warning bell rings. Indians are attacking a nearby settlement; it might be wiped out.<br />
<br />
Too damn bad, decides the new commanding officer. The ceremony will go on, regardless of how many settlers are being massacred just short charge away.<br />
<br />
Paul Piaget plays the straight-laced officer who gives that order, but Maj. Sugar Patterson is the star of this show. He’s a lovable rogue who opens the film in the guardhouse, for insubordination, of course.<br />
<br />
He’s decorated his cell with drawings of shapely women and his time of service is about to run out. But he keeps finding himself being drawn back into the action, both out of self-preservation and a sense of duty.<br />
<br />
One night, he heads out to scout an Indian village with Piaget’s character. Moments later, he’s kissing one of the prettiest little Indian squaws you’ll ever find in a Spaghetti Western.<br />
<br />
Turns out she’s named Amanda. And later on, she plays guitar as a ruse so her new girlfriend Nelly can escape from Sugar. Yep, more silliness." Written by Mark Franklin on onceuponatimeinawestern.com<br />
