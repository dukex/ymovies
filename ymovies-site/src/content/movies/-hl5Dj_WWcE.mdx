Reviews:<br />
"  Sugar Colt" is an excellent movie that belongs in a list of the top 20 Italian westerns for me. Definitely the best role Hunt Powers ever got in Europe and this genre, as he went on to make Django flicks with Fidani, but "Sugar Colt" is memorable also for its unusual script about criminal investigators in the wild west, which makes "Sugar Colt" a comedy in the first half and a serious brutal western in the second half - which is absolutely making sense because the main character is totally changing when he gives up his disguise as doctor Cooper and becomes the gunman Sugar Colt. Composer Luis E Bacalov ("Django") uses two different themes here to illustrate this: the "Sugar Colt" leitmotif, and the soldiers' theme with the trumpet. Spanish photographer Alejandro Ulloa who also shot Corbucci's "Mercenario" and Castellari's "Ammazzali tutti e torna solo" achieves the perfect western look near Almeria, partly at the same locations "For A Few Dollars More" was shot at. Together with the skill of director Giraldi ("Seven Guns for the MacGregors") and the legendary Soledad Miranda in her best western role, this is a must have for a "Western all'italiana" collection even if currently harder to find than many others. I've got an Italian language DVD with French subtitles in well restored picture quality." Written by unbrokenmetal on IMDb.com.<br />
<br />
"The main theme to Sugar Colt reminds me of Ennio Morricone's theme for My Name is Nobody made seven or so years later. Luis Bacalov provides the score and Hunt Powers (aka Jack Betts) provides the charisma for this serio-comic quasi-secret-agent spaghetti western with the renowned Sugar Colt (Powers) going undercover to the town of Snake Valley to investigate the disappearance of a regiment of Union sharpshooters at the end of the Civil War. Most of the humor comes from his posing as Dr. Tom Cooper, mild mannered yet accomplished at boxing and fooling the henchmen of the kidnapper. But the film turns more serious once he reveals himself as Sugar Colt, and the recovery of the regiment takes on a tragic air as supporting characters start to drop. Powers is good in this, as he was in most of his starring efforts in Italy; one wonders why he now acts in small parts under his true name Jack Betts. Perhaps, like Nicholetta Machiavelli and some others, fame did not rest lightly on his shoulders...or perhaps he just hated the name Hunt Powers (it does remind one of Dash Riprock) and having had his minutes of fame in Europe, is content being a journeyman actor. Three stars out of four, and fans of Euro-Westerns will like it better than others. Fans of Soledad Miranda will be delighted by her appearance here." Written by heybhc on IMDb.com.<br />
