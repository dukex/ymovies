Storyline:<br />
Scully has forced Joe Collins who works on the Garcia ranch to give him information so his men can steal the family jewels. But the Rough Riders are on the job. Buck poses as a wanted outlaw to get into the gang, Tim as a cattle buyer, and Sandy is collecting information as the saloon janitor. As usual they pretend not to know each other.<br />
<br />
Reviews:<br />
"It all starts when Buck Jones is riding in a stagecoach in the badlands with the lady voted the "prettiest white girl in Shanghai", Linda Brent and her aunt (Eva Puig). Ray Hatton is undercover as a janitor in a bar and Tim McCoy as a cattle buyer from Kansas. Dennis Moore is playing both sides of the fence but he's playing with fire with the likes of Ed Scully (Roy Barcroft) and Steve Slade (Charles King). No one plays a better sheriff than Jack Rockwell. A great Rough Rider scene when Tim stops a bully picking on Ray, "Well, some people are born to handle mops; some are not, as you seem to know so much about. Just pick up that mop and show him how". Our trio of stars work great together in this one. Makes you wish there were more movies in the Rough Rider series."<br />
