Charles Alderson and his wife settle in the Wyoming Territory, and form a lasting friendship with Thomas Jefferson "Windy" Gibson. Alderson's wife dies in childbirth, leaving him with an infant daughter, who he sends to Europe for an education. During the years in which she is abroad, Alderson becomes a wealthy cattle baron. The daughter, Karen, returns to Wyoming soon after it has been admitted to statehood. She finds that much of the land her father has considered as his own is now open to homesteaders, and that hostilities have broken out between the two factions. Alderson's foreman, Glenn Forrester, a former lawyer with whom Karen falls in love, warns Alderson against using violence in dealing with the homesteaders. Duke Lassiter, a smooth operator dealing in cattle rustling, sets himself up as a spokesman for the homesteaders and uses their fight with Alderson to further his own interests. When Lassister murders Windy, Alderson hires a gang of outlaws to war on the homesteaders.<br />

Reviews:<br />
"Wyoming is one of Bill Elliott's better westerns, it has a nice cast of familiar western names who know their way around a movie set corral. The plot is more complex than you usually find in a Republic B western. All in all a good introduction to cowboy hero Wild Bill Elliott."<br />
- written by "bkoganbing" on IMDb.com<br />
<br />
"WYOMING's assets are vigorous action sequences--especially notable is a down and dirty fistfight between Elliott and Dekker; top calibre black and white photography by John Alton; fine villainy by Dekker.<br />
<br />
While not as intriguing as the westerns Elliott would do later (in 1949 and 1950) at Republic Pictures, this is a solid "B" effort worthy of your time and attention."<br />
