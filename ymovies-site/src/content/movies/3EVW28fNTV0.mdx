In 1866 New Mexico, Tom Corbett is a prospector who is called back to his hometown in Laramie Town, Texas at the bequest of a old family friend. Tom arrives in the town to see it under the control of a ruthless and greedy gangster named Jason Scott, who's psychotic and murder-crazed son, Junior Scott, runs it with fear with a posse of thugs who kill anyone who protests their business tactics. Tom finds his brother Jeff, a drunkard looked after by their family maid Mercedes. Tom then tries to persuade Jeff to help him take down the sadistic Scotts so the town can rest easy in peace and harmony again. Written by matt-282

Reviews:
"I think this one has to get an award for putting all the classic Spaghetti Western elements together seamlessly into one movie. It's very 1966 and Franco Nero is obviously trying to adopt an Eastwood mannerism. For those that love these, it's an interesting transitional piece by a director that didn't do this filone. I think he did a great job and it's well worth seeing. It transcends the "must see" label because you will actually remember it, imho.

Consumer warning: If you play the "have a shot of tequila when they do" game watching these, this one will waste you. They fire it down pretty regularly. It's a killer. I've never seen so many tequila and whiskey slugs in one movie. lol Maybe that's the message. "Shots not slugs!"

Food pairing: Bison Swiss Cheese Burgers with Fries" Written by adrianswingler on IMDb.com.
