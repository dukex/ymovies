Synopsis:
Colonel William Cody, alias Buffalo Bill (Gordon Scott), is determined to put an end to illegal gun running between a gang of white smugglers and a Lakota Sioux named Yellow Hand. When Buffalo Bill goes to Wise Fox, the chief of Yellow Hand's tribe, and tries to convince him to sign a peace treaty with the federal troops, Yellow Fox gets wind of the plan and abducts Wise Fox's daughter, making it look like the soldiers are responsible. His deception succeeds and the Indians attack the army outpost. The only way peace can be restored is by Buffalo Bill defeating Yellow Hand in a climactic, savage, one-on one fight.

Reviews:
Muscleman Gordon Scott swaps his loincloth/tunic for a buckskin fringe jacket, jeans and a six gun in this entertaining euro western. It classed as a spaghetti western, but it eschews the gritty and anti-hero elements of that ilk. This western is a traditional shoot-em up a la John wayne-style with colourful locations, and there's plenty of intense action. Every western lexicon is covered here: barroom brawls, saloon shoot em ups, and exciting staged Indian fort attack. There's a naive charm about it with a lot of colour and energy.
