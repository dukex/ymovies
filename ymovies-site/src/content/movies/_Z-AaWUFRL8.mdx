Story:<br />
Eduardo Belmonte overhears his new step-mother, Maria, and her lover, Don Ricardo Gonzales plotting to take over the Belmonte rancho on the night of the fiesta given by her husband, Don Carlos Belmonte. Eduardo offers Maria money if she will depart the hacienda premises, but she refuses and then accuses Eduardo of making love to her. The old Don doesn't take kindly to his son hitting on his step-mother and attacks him in a rage. The lights go out, the father is killed and Maria blames Eduardo, who escapes from the house, chased by Ricardo's men. The Cisco Kid and Pancho rescue Eduardo, who has been shot, and hide him while they investigate. Cisco discovers that bullets from Maria's gun, a handy little derringer, are the same type that killed Don Carlos. But the Alcalde arrests Cisco and Pancho, and Cisco is "supposedly" executed by a firing squad, but IS NOT shot and escapes by a trick. And now Maria and Ricardo are in real trouble with Cisco on the loose.<br />

Review:<br />
I love Gilbert Roland's Cisco Kid<br />
Robin Hood of Monterey (1947)<br />
<br />
I'm aging myself here, being a big fan of the Cisco Kid TV series with Duncan Renaldo as the "gentleman of the old west" and his side-kick, Pancho played by lovable Leo Carrillo. This film isn't as sanitized as the 1950s TV show.<br />
<br />
Gilbert Roland's version is closer to the lovable rogue that O. Henry had written about in "The Caballero's Way", and even that early talky western "In Old Arizona" (1928). This one has Chris-Pin Martin as Pancho, his loyal side-kick. Gilbert's character will actually speak Spanish or has an authentic accent. He isn't above smoking, drinking, robbery and stealing kisses from pretty señoritas.<br />
<br />
The story line is pretty light-weight and light-hearted, but quite enjoyable. Written by rickrudge on imdb.com<br />
