Reviews:
"This interesting western contains a story full of humanity , good dramatic pacing and skillful direction . Pleasant Chorizo-Spaghetti Western produced mostly by Spain and involving Italian supporting players ; it does not follow in the wake of Sergio Leone and proceeds in the American style . The film is full of action, gunfights, drama, good feelings, a large number of corpses and is very fast and entertaining. It is a thrilling western with spectacular exteriors and an impressive showdown between the protagonists, Robert Hundar and Paul Piaget; and both against the heartless Ralf Baldasarre and his henchmen. Acceptable action sequences with thrilling Indian attacks against the Northern fort and spectacularly realistic gunfights. Charismatic performances by the entire cast. Well-known Spaghetti actor Robert Hundar is fine in his usual tough guy role. Fantastic performance by the always great Fernando Sancho in a sympathetic role , he would later play similar characters , plus the slimy and menacing outlaw played by Ralf Baldassarre , here in his ordinary bandit role and in a cruelly evil character . Appearing as supporting cast are the usual Spanish/Italian Western regulars such as Francisco Sanz , Lorenzo Robledo , Beni Deus , Luis Induni , Gaspar Indio Gonzalez , Alfonso Rojas and of course Alvaro De Luna who is still playing . The musician Riz Ortalani composes a nice soundtrack , well conducted , which turns out to be one of the most memorable parts of the film ; as it is full of pleasant sounds and haunting musical background and pleasant leitmotif . Very good photography shot by Rafael Pacheco in locations in Tabernas and the desert of Almeria , as usual ; including good sets by Cubero and Galicia who are the ones who have done more production design in the Western shot in Spain .

The film is finely directed and in personal style by Joaquin Luis Romero Marchent at his best. He is an expert screenwriter and director of good westerns. His first film was ¨El Coyote¨ and the sequel titled ¨Revenge of Coyote¨ shot in Mexico . After that, he filmed "La sombra del Zorro" and "La venganza del Zorro". He went on to direct westerns such as ¨Cabalgando hacia la muerte¨ , ¨Aventuras en el Oeste¨ , ¨Tres hombres buenos¨ , ¨Sabor Venganza¨ and the more popular and violent ¨Condenados a Vivir¨ . He also wrote for his brother Rafael Romero Marchent the following westerns: ¨Manos Torpes¨ , ¨Ocaso un Pistolero¨ and ¨Garringo¨ . Rating: Better than average. Worth seeing".
