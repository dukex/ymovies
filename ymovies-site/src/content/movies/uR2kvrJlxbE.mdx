Review:
A veteran of the Indian wars, Johnny Rush returns to his home to find that it has been confiscated by a cattle baron taking over in the valley. Rush also finds that his girl is engaged to the baron, because the girl's fathers' ranch is in financial jeopardy. When Rush loses the use of his gun arm in a fight with the barons henchmen, he learns to use a bow and arrow for defense...with deadly consequences.

The Lonesome Trail reminds me of TERROR IN A TEXAS TOWN, and not just because the heroes toted an unconventional weapon ( John Agar uses a bow and arrow against the bad guys in this one), but because there's a similar starkness and grimness in the characters- nothing glamorous here. The town street is rutted, the close-up shots of visages are oily and the action is exciting and a little violent. One guy gets a nasty cut on his face by a bullet. Well-acted and quite tense, though the old man can rabbit on too much. This good western ends with a brilliantly tense showdown.
