Reviews:
"Ardisson should have done more spags. He had the look and the chops to pull off the laconic protagonist. This film is a stark reminder of what might have been, as director Musolino passed away at a young age after making only two films (this being the better one). It is well made, with a style that reminds of Leone without completely ripping the master off." Written by haskel-72951 on IMDb.com.

"Standard violent revenge story. Ardisson was always good as an action man in the 60s and early 70s and who doesn't love Sanchez in his usual jovial roles? The use of music from Goldfinger unfortunately took me out of the story when it appeared. There's less female pulchritude than usual for a Euro western. Cristina Iosani's exotic and busty sex appeal, on display in Robert Woods' My Name Is Pecos, is covered up in long dresses here as she plays Ardisson's love interest. The Gatling gun sequence is loud but bloodless, like it is in most westerns and US TV shows with the exception of The Wild Bunch." Written by jameselliot-1 on IMDb.com.
