Storyline:<br />
A bounty-hunter (Dean Reed) is hired by the residents of a small town on the Mexican border to stop a series of gold robberies by marauding outlaws who are coordinated by the town's corrupt banker.<br />
<br />
Reviews:<br />
""Machine Gun Killers" director Paolo Bianchini has helmed a clever, rambunctious, 90-minute, Spaghetti western shoot'em up based on Fernando Di Leo's gritty screenplay that pits a splendidly attired, Paladin-type, ladies man, troubleshooter named Slim Corbett (Dean Reed of "Adios Sabata") who travels in style in an elegant carriage and requires a thousand dollars a week plus expenses for his services. Indeed, handsome Dean Reed resembles Roger Moore from the NBC-TV series "Maverick" in his stylish suit of clothes and handy way with cards. The very important people of Wells City have hired Corbett after they discover that their bank has been robbed during the night and no clues are available. "God Creates Them, I Kill Them" benefits from the scenic widescreen cinematography of "Today It's Me... Tomorrow It's You!" lenser Sergio D'Offizi who captures all the action with a sense of style. The camera work is excellent, too, especially when the camera dollies around the actors during a shoot-out.<br />
<br />
"God Creates Them, I Kill Them" opens rather like "God Forgives, I Don't" as the banker and his assistants enter the bank in the morning and find all the money in the safe gone and guards sprawled around dead without a clue in sight. No sooner have the promienent citizens of Wells City agree to hire Corbett than he finds himself in trouble when he rides into town. Several ruffians try to take advantage of him and he shoots them. Corbett is a deadly accurate marksman. The town judge, Judge Kincaid (Ivano Staccioli of "Any Gun Can Play"), is the only one among the citizens that aligns himself with Corbett. Interestingly, one of those prominent citizens is Don Luis (Peter Martell of "The Cobra"), a wealthy Mexican landowner. Don Luis defies the usual stereotype of the sweaty, overweight Mexican who bellows with laughter after he says anything. It is interesting to note in one scene that Don Luis tortures a peasant type who has been working in cahoots with our hero.<br />
<br />
Although he is no Sergio Leone when it comes to choreographing gunfights, Bianchini stages several decent shoot-outs with our handsome hero knocking down the opposition like ten-pins in a bowling alley. This Spaghetti western has enough shoot-outs and scheming to please fans of the genre and the production values are above-average." Written by zardoz-13 on IMDb.com<br />
