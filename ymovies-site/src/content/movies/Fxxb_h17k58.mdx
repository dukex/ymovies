Storyline:
Ettore Manni is Jonas Dickerson and Andres Resino is Mark Tabor, quarreling friends who wind up in Denver.

That’s when they seem to get their lucky break. A thirsty old-timer named Tripper stumbles into town. Tabor gives him a drink from his canteen. In return, the old-timer shares a secret: He’s discovered gold in Dead Man’s Gulch.

So off to Dead Man’s Gulch go Dickerson and Tabor. The rest of Denver soon follows. Seems Tripper’s not very good at keeping secrets.

He even shares the secret with the conniving town mayor named Muller (Gordon Mitchell), who doesn’t head to the hills.

Instead, he sends out his henchmen to rob the miners as they head back into town.

And if that doesn’t work, he plans to drain their pockets dry in the saloon he’s operating with the help of a trio of pretty ladies and a pair of card cheats. Written by Mark Franklin on http://onceuponatimeinawestern.com.

Reviews:
"This comedy is not so funny than his "hard" western but it has it's moments and Ettore Manni and "Bud Randall"(whoever he is) are a good "buddy" team. You can also see a lot of actors who you can also see in the most of the other Fidanis like his daughter Simonetta Vitelli (in her last movie), Frederico Boido, Benito Pacifico, Luciano Conti and the greatest of all: Gordon Mitchell.

You have to like trash to like this movie but it's a good little movie for rainy afternoons." Written by garko80 on IMDb.com.
