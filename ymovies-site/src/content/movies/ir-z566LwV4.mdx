Reviews: 
"The first time i watched this film i was surprised at how good it was. We spag western fans are always searching for the next "good one" and let me tell you, there are many "bad ones" to wade through in the process. I want him dead has been called gritty in every review i have ever read about it and it is. It is also a kick but revenge western with a kick butt Craig Hill performance. He has also done a few other spags worth mention. The dirty fifteen aka. fifteen scaffolds for the killers and no graves on boot hill by Sergio Garrone being at the top of my list. I want him dead has great camera work and the score is superb. It fits the film like a glove. Jose Manuel Martin plays the antagonist and many other spag regulars will be spotted by any fan of the genre. I have the Franco Cleef version of the film. To my knowledge it is the best English language version available. Franco Cleef is the man!! Go Franco Go!!!!!! He puts together English language versions of rare spag westerns for English speaking fans that would have no other way to watch these fantastic films. Thanks Franco for everything you do."
