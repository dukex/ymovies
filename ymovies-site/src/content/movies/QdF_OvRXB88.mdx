Storyline:
It's 1867 Texas. The American Civil War has ended but a handful of Confederate commanders and their units refuse to accept defeat and surrender. One of these commanders is Colonel Thomas Blake. He and his men raid the farms, towns and settlements where Yankees live. Rumors abound about Colonel Blake having gone insane. Many claim that Blake robs and kills for his own pleasure and personal gain rather than in the name of Confederacy. The authorities post huge rewards for the capture or killing of Colonel Blake and his men. However, Blake is shrewd and hard to entrap. He too wants money. More specifically, Colonel Blake is after the 200 thousand dollars that vanished in the final days of the war from the Confederate coffers. The money was last seen in the strong box of Confederate General Beauregard. Blake sends a trusted aide, Chamaco Gonzales, to inquire among the Confederate veterans and disbanded soldiers about the whereabouts of General Beauregard's strong box. But Chamaco is ...

Reviews: 
"Crazed Confederate raider Guy Madison can't stop raiding, even after the Civil War is over and done with. Ex-Confederate Edd "Kookie" Byrnes knows where a fortune in confederate treasure is buried and needs the bloodthirsty Madison and his band of cutthroats to get there, leading to an uneasy alliance and a harrowing trip across the frontier.

Another of director Enzo G. Castellari's patented brand of light-hearted adventure films, Payment In Blood is a decent enough, if not very original movie. It does have it's share of good action scenes, locations, and performances by it's lead actors, benefiting greatly from Byrnes charisma and Madison's machismo. The climax at the Indian burial ground is pretty neat too.

Castellari is actually pretty good at setting up and directing action sequences. He made his fair share of good movies, but I feel he really could have knocked it out of the park (and still can) if given the right script." Written by FightingWesterner on IMDb.com.

"Enzo G. Castellari was a director who seemed to contribute films in a variety of genres, from sci-fi to giallo. I get the feeling that his best ones are his spaghetti westerns though. In Payment in Blood he delivers a pretty solid entry. Its story features a renegade Confederate colonel who refuses to accept the South's defeat in the American Civil War and so continues the fight with a band of outlaws. A stranger saves one of his gang from execution and is taken into their fold when he reveals that he knows the whereabouts of a casket of buried money.

It would only be fair to say that the plot-line has quite a few similarities with Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy. Its hero, however, looks a little different from the shady leads from other spaghettis. He looks more like a character from an American traditional western, although he still has the same amorality and essentially acts in a similar way. The villains are decent enough and there is a fair amount of violent action to keep us entertained. Things are wrapped up with an interesting enough climax in an Indian burial ground, located in a cave. Overall, this is an entertaining, if unremarkable, western and should definitely find approval with fans of the Italian strand." Written by Red-Barracuda on IMDb.com.
