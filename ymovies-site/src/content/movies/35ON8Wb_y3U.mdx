Storyline:
Dan Tomlinson, aka Will Sabre, head of a gang of outlaws, states his intentions to go straight but is warned by the new gang leader, Dunsten, that he has thirty days to come back to the gang---or else. On his way back to his hometown and girl, Judy, Dan picks up 10-year-old Robbie whose father has been killed. Dan gets a job as a bank teller and suspicion falls on him when a hold-up occurs and he doesn't use his guns. And, Dunsten and his former gang plants evidence to make it appear as if Dan cooperated with them. Dan is accused and now has to find a way to capture Dunsten and his gang, and clear his name.

Reviews:
"George Montgomery plays Will Sabre--an outlaw. However, he's sick of the life and wants to retire--but his gang vows to kill him if he does. But, they like him so they give him 30 days to change his mind...or else.

On his way into town, Sabre happens upon an orphan. Robbie's father is dead and he's stranded along the trail. Sabre feels sorry for him and takes the boy with him into Durango. There he gets a job and tries to make something of himself--renaming himself Dan Tomlinson. But the gang is an ever-present threat. What is he to do? As is the case with all of George Montgomery's westerns I've seen, this is a very very competent and well made lower-budgeted film. Montgomery is excellent as always and they manage to make rather ordinary stuff a bit better than it should be. Well worth seeing.

By the way, the trivia section on IMDb is mistaken. It says that the boy Robbie was played by a 20 year-old. Bobby Clark was only 12 or 13 when the film debuted, as he was born in 1944."-Written by MartinHafer on IMDb.com
