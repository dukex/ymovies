Reviews:
"Andre de Toth directs faultlessly here bringing a big surprise to anyone who thought that 1950's westerns were watered down versions of reality. This is possibly the most uncompromising and bleak vision of the old west that I can remember seeing for a film from the 1950's. Brilliantly photographed against a backdrop of snow, hills and forests, with wonderfully composed shots of both actors and scenery, this is a minor masterpiece. Terrific choice of actors headed by tough guy Robert Ryan, folk singer Burl Ives and the beautiful Tina Louise with great supporting actors, Dabs Greer, Elisha Cook Jr, Jack Lambert etc. Great story, unfolding slowly and with completely unexpected events occurring throughout. Just when you think something is going to explode, de Toth holds it all back,racking up the tension to the bitter end. The best western I've watched in years. If only they made pictures like this still." Written by a.lampert on IMDb.com

"One of the coolest stand offs in western history, between the town folks and the outlaws they hired to keep out other outlaws. Their hired hands that they used for their dirt are no longer needed now they want to go 'legit'. Roll the bottle on the bar, when it drops, we draw! Before it can Burl Ives and his men bust in. They are raw, hungry and and extremely un-PC. Their leader is dying, if he does, the dogs he hired to protect him will, rob and pillage and....Tina Louise, playing against the Gilligan Isle type, most know her from. Ives, far from the nice snowman most know him from. Robert Ryan being the badA$%& we know he can be. I love this movie. And fantastic character actors, I might not remember their names off the top of my head but their contribution will not leave my hollow head for quiet some time. Enjoyable, on surface also, one could draw some parallels between this fictional story and the story on how most towns/businesses go "legit" usually started on illicit means. Story of 'Merica ? Maybe. This movie is probably overlooked in the DVD bargain bin at your local big lot box store. Well worth the 2 for 5, even if your second selection bites, this one will be well worth it."
