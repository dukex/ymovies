<br />
Reviews:<br />
"A man known as "Desperaaadooo" to his enemies and the singer of the title song, or simply Steve (Andrea Giordana, "Quella sporca storia nel west") to his friends, tries to make money outside the law at the end of the civil war. He stops at nothing, even stealing it from a blind man seems not to trouble him. Nevertheless, when that old man is killed, Desperado decides to avenge his death. Not only the presence of Piero Lulli (plays the blind man) reminds me of "Se sei vivo, spara". Just like Questi's masterpiece, "El Desperado" - directed by "Django", "Texas Addio" and "Preparati la bara" screenplay co-writer Rossetti - picks up the subject of everyone's obsessive greed that leads to self-destruction as well as moral decomposition. Even priests and judges can not be trusted in this movie. It's a dirty world, so the long torture/murder scene in the mud is apt. Regarding the tavern brawl scene in the middle of the movie, it is by no means a standard genre scene! Steve requires that fight so he can kill one of his enemies unnoticed, it is a deliberate part of his revenge plan! Also, there are little touches like the piano player beating up somebody who by mistake hit a chord on his instrument. Very well directed, thus it is a pity it remained Rossetti's only western."

"It's too bad Franco Rossetti didn't make more westerns; this is his only oater and it's a pretty good spaghetti western. I liked Chip Corman (Andrea Giordana) as Steve, El Desperado, who spends much of his screen time in a Confederate soldier uniform masquerading as a blind man's returning son. He's not, of course, he's really after a stash of gold the blind man has been saving, hidden in a ghost town that's right out of Django, all mud and muck. Pretty soon though a gang shows up to waylay a Confederate payroll that's rolling through the town. The only negatives are the unavoidable fistfight/barroom brawl and a scene where Desperado gets kicked around in the mud which goes on too long. The finale is great and makes up for quite a bit of the typical spaghetti hi-jinx which leaves non-fans of the genre cold. If you like pasta you'll dig this almost unknown gem. Just released by Wild East, this has a good widescreen transfer and looks great!" Written by heybhc on IMDb.com <br />
