Reviews:<br />
"This is really a cult within a cult. The first few scenes are the standard revenge and search for gold spaghetti fare. However, after the bandits entire the strange town, the movie really enters a surreal land. I was quite bemused watching the various sub-plots but it was extremely compelling. It gives the impression of two scriptwriters who love westerns just brainstorming the most outrageous script. Despite its confused feel I give it 10/10 as it has many startling, original and occasionally jaw dropping moments'. Highlights are , 'digging for gold in the bandit', Zorro the 'affable sadist', the black-shirted gay muchachos, the commentary by the parrot and the liquids gold 'House of Wax scene. What the 'traditionalist American Cowboy fans make of the gay muchachos, god only knows. Highly recommended." Written by washboard on IMDb.com<br />
<br />
"DJANGO KILL is one excellent Spaghetti Western. The only problem with the film is that it loses steam by the end and it's a shame because if the direction, the pacing and the story had remained the same throughout the movie as during the first hour, this would have been a masterpiece. The direction is truly unique and there's something contemporary about the whole first hour. But when the action starts resembling a soap opera of sorts, the greatness of the beginning is almost completely gone. But even if the second half is not as spectacular as the first half, DJANGO KILL is still one of the best Euro westerns I've ever seen. I've watched the Blue Underground DVD several times now."
