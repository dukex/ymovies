<br />
The Lonesome Trail reminds me of TERROR IN A TEXAS TOWN, and not just because the heroes toted an unconventional weapon ( John Agar uses a bow and arrow against the bad guys in this one), but because there's a similar starkness and grimness in the characters- nothing glamorous here. The town street is rutted, the close-up shots of visages are oily and the action is exciting and a little violent. One guy gets a nasty cut on his face by a bullet. Well-acted and quite tense, though the old man can rabbit on too much. This good western ends with a brilliantly tense showdown.<br />
