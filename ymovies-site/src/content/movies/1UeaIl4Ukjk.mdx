Reviews:<br />
"A very well-written and well-acted, beautifully produced story that moves fast and rides hard-but stops here and there for some truly awesome moments of drama, and even some humor in well-placed spots. There are certain scenes and shots that literally made me and my fellow viewers gasp. Satisfying and well-rounded in the classic Western style but with some new twists. The cinematography captures the epic sweep of the Old West and the characters are larger than life but in a very authentic way, the way a great Western should be. I highly recommend it!"<br />
