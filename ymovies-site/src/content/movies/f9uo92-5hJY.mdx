Storyline:
Twelve years ago, Sartana framed his brother Johnny for murder and stole his girlfriend. Now the town's undisputed boss and doted over by his possessive mother, Sartana seems safe - until, his sentence served, Johnny rides back into town.

Reviews:
"Steffen and Garko have been in a lot of awful movies, no doubt about that, so "Sartana" can easily be considered a climax in their careers, respectively.

It's the story of two brothers fighting each other, Steffen playing the straight and honest one, Garko portraying a sadistic, screaming blond loony. Their mother tries to stop him. Intense pictures, intense emotions, the director even alluded to Shakespearean tragedies a few times, but you needn't take that too seriously. All in all, well done, spaghetti western above average."

"Decent and morally upright Johnny Liston (an excellent and sympathetic performance by Anthony Steffen) gets out of jail after serving twelve years. He vows to get revenge on his evil and ruthless despot brother Sartana (robustly played with deliciously vicious aplomb by Gianni Garko), who framed Johnny for murder and stole his girlfriend Manuela Holt (lovely Angelica Ott). Director Alberto Cardone, working from a dark and uncompromising script by Ernesto Gestaldi and Rolf Olsen, relates the absorbing story at a steady pace, does an expert job of creating and sustaining an extremely tough and gritty tone, milks the potent sibling rivalry theme for all it's worth, and stages the rousing rough'n'tumble fisticuffs and stirring shoot-outs with considerable gusto. Steffen and Garko do sterling work in the lead roles; they receive able support from Erika Blanc as the fiery Joselita, Robert Miali as hapless browbeaten mute Jerry, Carla Calo as the bitter, boozy Rhonda Liston, Franco Fantasia as the weak, ineffectual sheriff, Sieghardt Rupp as the nasty Ralph, and Carlo D'Angelo as the crooked, slippery Judge Waldorf. Gino Santini's sumptuous cinematography offers plenty of bold and startling compositions (the sweeping panoramic shots of the dusty and desolate desert are especially striking and impressive). Michele Lacerenza's twangy and harmonic score likewise hits the flavorsome spot. But it's the film's remarkably hard and harsh no-nonsense mood which in turn gives this movie an extra jolting edge: the villains are truly hateful and sadistic, the outbursts of violence are quite savage and shocking (even women and children aren't spared from the copious brutality), and the climactic bloodbath is both wild and exciting. Well worth seeing." Written by Woodyanders on IMDb.com.
