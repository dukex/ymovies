Reviews:
"An Italian-Spanish co-production full of action , exaggerated characters, shootouts and loads of violence . There is plenty of action in the movie , guaranteeing some shoot'em up or stunts every few minutes . There's also an interesting intrigue and whodunit with some Giallo when happens a killing spree , and the question is : Who is the killer ? For money, for pleasure, for revenge, he doesn't care why he kills or how ¡ . A family formed by a mother (Margarita Lozano) and two daughters (Eleonora Brown) is cruelly killed and are accused two different bands who are facing each other . One gang (Jose Canalejas) is led by Billy Mack (Graig Hill) and another one (Frank Braña) is commanded by Sandy Cassel (George Martin) . When the fiancé named Bud Lee (Howard Ross) of a murdered girl learns the slaughter and atrocity committed he executes a single-handedly revenge , ravages and kills each person involved in the massacre . Bud is relentless in his vendetta , deadly in his violence . Then the two bands flee and go to the town which is inhabited by important people as the Sheriff ( Antonio Molino Rojo) , the banker , the priest (Andrea Bosic), the doctor (Umberto Raho) and a gorgeous Pastor's priest named Barbara Ferguson (Susy Andersen) , among others . But Barbara is kidnapped as hostage and the bandits get away to Mexico . They arrive in a Mexican village but are besieged by a posse (Antonio Molino , Aldo Sambrell , Alvaro De Luna) formed to chase them . There takes place violent fights , facing off , hangings and final surprise about the killer's identity .

It's an exciting western with breathtaking showdown between the protagonist Graig Hill and George Martin and his hoodlums . Both of whom are fine , they ravage the screen, kill , shoot , hit and run , besides receive violent punches, kicks and hitting . Aldo Sambrell as a cruelly baddie role is terrific, he subsequently would play very secondary or minimum characters . Furthermore, there appears usual Italian/Spanish Western secondaries as Alvaro De Luna, Rafael Albaicin, Jose Canalejas , Antonio Molino Rojo , Ricardo Palacios , Jose Luis Martin and of course Frank Braña . The film blends violence , blood , tension , high body-count and it's fast moving and quite entertaining . There is a very odd implementation of shots in the camera work during some particular scenes as the film approaches its climax , as in the final gunfights and the customary showdown conclusion.
