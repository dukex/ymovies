Entertaining Chorizo/Schnitzel Western well produced by Alfons Carcasona with shoot'em up , action , violence , go riding , saloon brawls and amusement . It is a passable Western with a lot of surprises , thrills and including a love story between a drifter become a sheriff , Gotz George , and a beautiful owner , Alexandra Stewart . This film , realized in American Western style and no Spaghetti , contains Western-action , gun-play , fist-play and being enough amusing but mediocre . This Spanish/German western , probably won't be making too many top ten lists, but its an agreeable flick . It's a thrilling western that scrutinizes the greed and paranoia that afflicts an avaricious advocate at law played by Helmut Schmid , including breathtaking crossfire between protagonists when are besieged at a ranch against the enemies during the ending . It's a medium budget film with good actors , technicians , production values , pleasing results and turned to be shot entirely on location . Here filmmaker Roy Rowland delivers a decently-paced film , however he could be counted on to deliver solid "B" pictures which, at MGM , were often better than most other studios' . It's a stirring western with breathtaking gunfight between the brave protagonist Gotz George against the heartless Helmut Schmid and his nasty hoodlums : Daniel Martin and Rupp . Their dynamic together is also great and is what mostly keeps this movie going . Most players result to be too clean to compare with Sergio Leone's 'Man With No Name', so the result is nothing particular: too pretty for grit, too gritty for a traditional B and even a script co-written by Clark Reynolds can't do much . The film blends violence , thrills , high body-count and it's fast moving and exciting . [...]" Written by ma-cortes on IMDb.com.<br />
