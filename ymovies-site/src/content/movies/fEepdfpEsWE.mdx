<br />
Reviews:<br />
"I may as well say at the outset that I am biased toward this movie. I liked westerns as a teenager and I liked westerns movies in color with recognizable actors. As an older fellow I now like mostly black and white movies westerns included. I stumbled on the production company filming this movie while on vacation with my folks in southern Utah desert in the summer of 1956. Iwas able to wander around the location and Stayed to watch about four takes of a two shot involving Okeefe and Cabot. After waiting eight months I saw the movie and a local theater and found the plot to be far more complex than most. This is not a run-of-the-mill 50s, one hero type, Western. I recommend it to anyone who likes some character development and appreciates the product of some of the good talents offered by Hollywood both in front of and behind the camera. I would like to find it on DVD." Written by hitt_dave on IMDb.com <br />

"Not as routine as it may sound-a cavalry captain and a wagon load of prisoners join forces on a trek through hostile Indian country. Fine acting from a strong cast, tight direction, and a rousing musical score make this one good fun." Written by bux on IMDb.com <br />
