Reviews: <br />
"Life was not easy in the 1800's and there are plenty of reasons to not want to bring certain aspects of life back then to the forefront, but Wild Faith is brave enough and coherent enough to both capture the world and its many flaws as well as present it in a respectful manner. The characters depicted are brought to life in a heartfelt way, with the actors and actresses performing top-tier emotion. I thoroughly enjoyed watching all of these great things come together. This film has certain segments that reveal an important past for one of our characters and the way that these scenes are woven through the narrative is seamless and a joy to experience. Collective Development Inc., the wonderfully talented people who created this film, have done it again." Written by joshuavankirk on IMDb.com<br />

"It's amazing when a story comes to life on the big screen and you feel you're a part of it, sitting on the edge of your seat in anticipation of what's going to happen next....Every aspect of Wild Faith is done exceptionally well...actors are true to character and the story line touches your heart....who could ask for more. Can't wait to see it again!" Written by wyw-67816 on IMDb.com<br />

"My husband and I saw this movie at Celebration Cinema in Lansing, Michigan. We LOVED it! Well written, engaging and the actors were incredible! Now I want to take our children to see it! It was so nice to see a wholesome, family film on the big screen for a change. 10 big starts from us! " Written by jsmgfrench on IMDb.com<br />

"A very well acted, well assembled film with a strong story line! I heard people talking about this film but it wasn't showing in theaters by me so I jumped in the car and drove almost 2 hours to see it. Let me tell you, it was worth the trip! Acting was on point, story was gripping and the score was compelling! If this shows anywhere near you, I'd suggest catching in in theaters!" Written by harleytheswede on IMDb.com<br />

"To say Wild Faith is an excellent display of fine movie making would be an understatement. It is majestic, it is brilliant, it is gorgeous, it is superbly acted, and directed with such precision. Each scene, each frame, each moment, capture the true essence of not only the great state of Michigan, but also kept the truth of the time in which it took place. Jesse Low, with all of his mastery, has captained a ship that will surely never sink. His close attention to detail from the period of time to the reverence of color, to the championing of his cast shall not go unnoticed. He has made a timeless piece and it's safe to say that he will captain a great many ships in the near future. The cast led by the great Shane Hagedorn and Lauren LaStrada all hit the mark in this film. Their subtlety, their presence, their range of emotion, their absolute pureness was a demonstration of how to propel a story into something deeply personal and re.latable. With great recommendation, I implore one to watch, to study and to enjoy this film just as I did. It most definitely will not disappoint!" Written by tayghazi on IMDb.com<br />

"I absolutely loved this movie from begging to end! I was able to see it the 1st day it released. Kept me at the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next. Definitely one the best films I have seen in awhile, very well done!" Written by kappayear on IMDb.com<br />
