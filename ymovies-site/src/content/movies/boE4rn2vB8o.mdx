Full Western Movie, Full Length Free Cowboy Film, English: Jesse & Lester - Due fratelli in un posto chiamato Trinità (original title), 1h 37min, Spaghetti Western. Two Brothers in Trinity or Two Brothers in a Place Called Trinity is a 1972 Italian Spaghetti western low comedy film directed by Renzo Genta and Richard Harrison, and produced by Fernando Piazza. It was originally called Due Fratelli (Two Brothers). It stars Gino Marturano, Luciano Rossi, and Osiride Pevarello.<br />
<br />
In this film the half brothers pair Jesse and Lester converges to lay their hands and what keepst them together is their inherited mind, as between Hallelujah and Sartana in Alleluja e Sartana, figli di... Dio (1972), the hero and the monk in Tedeum (1972) and Slim and the pizza baker/preacher in Posate le pistole... reverendo (1971).<br />
<br />
Charming, blithely amoral devil-may-care rogue Jesse Smith and peaceful, devout straight-arrow Mormon Lester O'Hara are estranged half brothers who are reunited after receiving a sizable inheritance from their deceased mother. The wildly contrasting mismatched duo get into all sorts of trouble while trying to claim said inheritance.<br />
<br />
Directors: Renzo Genta (as James London), Richard Harrison<br />
Writer: Renzo Genta (screenplay)<br />
Stars: Richard Harrison, Donald O'Brien, Anna Zinnemann<br />

<br />
Jesse & Lester are two half-brothers who inherit a piece of land in a place called Trinity; Jesse is a philanderer who’s also quick on the draw, Lester a Mormon who’s opposed to violence. Jesse plans to build the biggest whorehouse in the history of the West on their new property, but Lester wants to build a church, so he can spread the word of God. The two get in all kinds of trouble while trying to claim their inheritance: it has been taken by a group of miners and an assorted bunch of no-goods and bandits is also on the lurk. Finally Jesse manages to fulfill his dream with the help of a German prostitute called Helena von Schäffer, but those bandits just won’t give up and in the end even Lester is forced to take up arms.<br />
