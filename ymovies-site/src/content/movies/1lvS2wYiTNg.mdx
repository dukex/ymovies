Reviews:
"After two of his rangers are killed Captain Drummond (William Gould) declares, "I'd give a lot to catch Travis red-handed." Tom Tyler goes undercover to infiltrate a gang of outlaws. He teams up with Rex Lease to fight the munitions smugglers led by Al Bridge. The leading lady in the great saloon dance scene is American circus star Margaret 'Gams' Nearing. The top henchman, Slim Whitaker, one of the most prolific western bad guys does great work in a supporting role."
