Wealthy local farmer, Tobias Brown (Marvin), also takes an interest in Biarn's future, but he treats the young man harshly, masking Tobias' real hidden feelings of affection and genuine concern. Biarn's mannerisms and willingness to help others, quickly wins the favor of the local townsfolk; And he also proves his worth by preparing a seemingly untrainable horse for a race that the town will hold during their annual 4th of July celebration.

Reviews:
This movie shows us how "the boy from Shane",has matured, still a soft talking very polite youth. He is a runaway in this movie and is groomed by Lee Marvin, a hard taskmaster who has made a name for himself as the poor boy who made good in this story. He takes unfair advantage of Brandon, but in the process, really teaches the youth some valuable lessons about life and how to take care of himself. These are lessons we can all learn from, and Gary Merrill provides care, comfort, and guidance for Brandon as he overcomes the hard "teaching" of Marvin. The film is anchored by the fine acting of Paul Ford, as usual, a leader of the business community, but with a soft heart for the troubled. This is a great family film, free of Hollywoods blood, guts, sex, and profanity. Written by billydpowell on IMDb.com
