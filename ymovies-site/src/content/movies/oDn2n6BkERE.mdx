Storyline:
In 19th century Spain, young sergeant Don José falls in-love with beautiful gypsy girl Conchita who works inside the military fort in a small workshop. There she gets in a fight with another woman and tries to stab her with a knife. Arrested, she is entrusted to Don José who must escort her to the police station in town. However, clever Conchita gives Don José the slip. Because of her escape, he is demoted to private and must pull additional guard duty. One night, Conchita shows up at the fort to see Don José who's on guard duty. While she apologizes to him and seduces him, she also distracts his attention from a small group of smugglers who enter the fort. Don José is furious and goes to see Conchita at her friend's place. Unfortunately, Conchita is there with a gentleman lover, an officer. In a fit of jealousy, Don José loses his head and punches the officer who falls and dies. Don José deserts the army and runs away with Conchita. She takes him to a gypsy camp where many smugglers live. Conchita and Don José plan to save money and board passage on a ship bound for a new life in America. In the camp appears one man, former Lt. Miguel Garcia, who has just been released from prison. A shocked Don José learns that Miguel Garcia is Conchita's husband...

Reviews:
"This is an adaption of the classic novel Carmen which puts the main characters into a Spaghetti Western setting, but instead of yet another Spaghetti Western director Luigi Bazzoni created a brooding drama full of psychological tension and visually spectacular sequences. If you are looking for an action movie, look somewhere else, although the movie does contain a very well photographed chase sequence.

Franco Nero again proves to be a great actor and Tina Aumont does a splendid job, too. Klaus Kinski is typecast as the crazy villain again and he again plays this part very well. Look out for the guest appearance of the Austrian Burgschauspieler Karl Schönböck!

Carlo Rustichelli's score matches the movie perfectly since it's a lavish mix of operatic music and brooding low-key pieces. (Get the soundtrack CD released by CAM!)

Only a heavily cut version made it to the German cinemas and again it was tried to sell a movie as yet another adventure of Django, which is even more nonsensical if the literary source of this movie is considered." Written by liderc on IMDb.com.
