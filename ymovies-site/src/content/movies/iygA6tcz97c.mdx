Storyline:<br />
At the Texas/Mexico frontier, during the Civil War, Colonel Greyson was accused of embezzling $ 500,000 that he was to deliver to the Confederate command. In fact, he was betrayed by four officers who accompanied him, and robed the money. When a young man reveals to be Bill Greyson, the son of the colonel, he is about to be lynched by the infuriated, and wrongly informed citizens. El Charro, the leader of a Mexican gang, tells the real story to Bill, and helps him in his revenge plan: to identify and eliminate the four men, who are now respected - and wealthy - citizens. El Charro expects the naive young man to be happy to rehabilitate his family name, and he will outsmart him and take the money. A public statement rehabilitates Bill, alright, and the money comes into the pockets of El Charro. Does crime pay?<br />
<br />
Reviews:<br />
"A young man seeks to prove his army officer father was not a traitor, to do so he sets out on a mission to take out the men who murdered him with the help of a Mexican bandit who knew his father.<br />
<br />
One Against One...No Mercy is a Paella Western. Like many others it is a Spanish-Italian co-production but unlike most, it is primarily an Iberian rather than a spaghetti production. Whatever the case, it sports a plot-line that can be found in many Italian westerns from the time seeing as it is essentially a revenge-themed story featuring a mysterious loner with superb weapon skills and with a comic Mexican bandit thrown in for good measure. So you could say that it isn't a film with a massive amount of originality. But I actually found this one to be clearly above average for this kind of thing. Its Spanish leanings came through by way of slightly less typical music and its feel was a little lighter overall. But it also has a very satisfying and pleasingly unpredictable ending which rounded things off rather well. The cast as a whole wasn't very familiar to me mostly, aside from Eduardo Fajardo who was the chief villain, he also played a very similar role in Sergio Corbucci's highly influential earlier spaghetti western, Django (1966). On the whole, this is one is well worth seeking out, especially if you wish to expand your knowledge of the Paella western sub-genre." Written by Red-Barracuda on IMDb.com.<br />
