Storyline:<br />
George Washington McLintock, "GW" to friends and foes alike, is a cattle baron and the richest man in the territory. He anxiously awaits the return of his daughter Becky who has been away at school for the last two years. He's also surprised to see that his wife Katherine has also returned. She had left him some years before without really explaining what he had done, but she does make the point of saying that she's returned to take their daughter back to the State Capitol with her. GW is highly respected by everyone around him, including the farmers who are pouring into the territories with free grants of land and the Indians who are under threat of being relocated to another reservation. Between his wife, his headstrong daughter, the crooked land agent and the thieving government Indian agent, GW tries to keep the peace and do what is best for everyone.<br />

Reviews:<br />
"The slapstick scenes in McLintock - notably the mud fight and the attempts by Wayne to help De Carlo mount the stairs at the ranch after over-imbibing - are every bit as much fun as many such scenes in all-out comedies. However, in spite of its humour, the movie manages to introduce some very important and serious ethical issues at a surprisingly early date. These include McLintock's support for the rights of the Native American people and also his attitude towards the land when he tells his daughter that he intends leaving most of the ranch to the nation as a park to prevent its exploitation by industry. One suspects these were issues dear to Wayne's heart. The stetson on the steer's horn of the weather vane remains an unmistakable image." Written by janettecook on IMDb.com.<br />
<br />
"McLintock is light comedy, western style. John Wayne is a cattle baron with family troubles. His wife is on the warpath and his daughter is just returning home from college with ideas of her own.<br />
<br />
Life is complicated by a greedy territorial governor and local federal officials who want to take advantage of the local Indian population. On top of everything else a mob of settlers show up wanting to set up shop as farmers.<br />
<br />
Thru all this are memorable barbecues, mud slide fights, a rodeo, and the climatic show down between John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara. Here's a hint ... if John Wayne AND Maureen O'Hara are in a movie, watch it.<br />
<br />
The DVD presentation is acceptable for a move of this age. However, make sure you get the DVD officially released by the Wayne family's company, Batjac. Before their release there were some cheap unofficial releases with terrible problems with the audio track, so beware of those." Written by vranger on IMDb.com.<br />
