Reviews:<br />
"The only thing I have to say is: Miles Deem. Almost all his movies are very bad also this one. The movie has bad actors, with exception from Southwood and Cameron, a bad story and a bad directing. The only good job made Marcello Gigante with his music." Written by garko80 on IMDb.com.<br />
