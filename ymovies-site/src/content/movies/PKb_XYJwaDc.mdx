Then he tracks the murderers and brings slow but steady vengeance upon them.<br />
<br />
Reviews:<br />
"This is one of the best comedy films I have ever seen. The story follows a bunch of amoral morons into the wild west. That may sound like a boring story, but it's told with such humor and madcap idiocy that one can't help but be entertained throughout the whole thing. The sight gags are pretty cool too. For example, the main Indian character, Cold Arm Warm Legs, wears a sweater with a breechcloth. This movie has it all - from stupid Bible misquotings, to Spanish speaking Indians, to a bathing woman and a love affair.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, you should stop reading this review and go buy this movie now!" Written by deadskunk18 via IMDb.com<br />

"One of the best of Starrett's low budget action-Pictures of the seventies, this intriguing Western was co-produced by its star, Jody (son of Joel)McCrea. Told in flashback by McCrea as an old man (played by Joel) as he reminisces about his past, McGregor's screenplay has McCrea and a bunch of prospectors slaughtering a band of Indians until the last one left, Gahva, promises to tell them the whereabouts of a gold mine and lead them there. On the way they are pursued by Gahva's brother, who murders them one by one (including director Starrett), until Gahva kills him to save McCrea." Written by discount1957 via IMDb.com<br />
