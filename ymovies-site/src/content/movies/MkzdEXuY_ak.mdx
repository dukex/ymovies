Story:
This is a Grindhouse style Spaghetti Western shot and made to look like the classic European Westerns of the 1960s and 1970s - True to the form of how they were filmed in the late 1960s, all the way down to the dubbing of the audio. Enjoy this great throwback to the old style with a brand new story in 6 BULLETS TO HELL. Also enjoy the "Drive-in Style' version with two Grindhouse trailers before the film begins. When a farmer's wife is brutally murdered by the ruthless bandit Bobby Durango and his gang of killers, Billy Rogers goes back to his old gun and starts to hunt them one by one.#

Review:
Purity of focus makes the whole greater than the sum of its parts
This revenge oater is as tight and direct as any tale of its kind, whether western, Asian martial arts or contemporary crime. We quickly learn why our firm-jawed hero will do what he's gotta, and how richly the recipients of his titular bullets deserve their fate. No time is wasted on extraneous dialog or lengthy displays of scenery while riding from one encounter to the next. There's nothing remarkable about the cast as performers, but two of them (Tanner Beard, Russell Quinn Cummings) doubled as directors, and delivered a crisp, no-nonsense package. For those of us who watch a sh**load of movies, efficient storytelling like this is greatly appreciated. Written by lotekguy-1 on imdb.com
