---

Full Fantasy Western Movie, Mystery Suspense, Full Length Cowboy Film, English: Arde baby, arde (1971) AKA Dead Aim AKA Burn Baby Burn, 1h 37min, Drama, Fantasy, Thriller: This stylish English-language Mexican western was first shown in 1971 at the Venice Film Festival as Arde, and was re-edited (with some new shots added) and re-released in 1974 as Arde baby Arde, or Burn Baby Burn. It bears a closer kinship with contemporary Italian "spaghetti" westerns than with the more conventional American variety. The story, which contains some bizarre touches (including necrophilia) concerns the efforts of a father and his adopted son to find the things they most want in life. Though for the father, gold holds much allure, love is the son's beacon. 

Director: José Bolaños (as José Antonio Balanos)
Writers: José Bolaños (as José Antonio Balanos), Pedro F. Miret (as Pedro Miret)
Stars: Glen Lee, Venetia Vianello, James Westerfield 

A traveling gravedigger during an (unspecified) war adopts a orphan he finds alone in the desert. After the war with the orphan grown and business slow, the orphan begins to generate business himself by shooting people. The orphan wants to make one big score by robbing a bank but the gravedigger resists. Their dream is to open a fancy funeral parlor and cemetery. The orphan becomes obsessed with a prostitute he saw who was later abandoned by her outlaw partner after a robbery attempt on a gold wagon goes bad. He eventually leaves the gravedigger to find her.

It’s the Civil War. A traveling gravedigger adopts an orphan he finds alone in the desert. With the boy grown, they wander through desert towns gathering the dead for burial, when they are unable to find any dead bodies they make their own! What begins as a western saga winds up as a wildly bizarre splatter flick.  A truly strange and surreal watching experience.
