''A right little stormer of a western, marked out by a good showing from George Hilton in the title role and a show stealing performance from the wonderful Frank Wolff as the villain "Black Tracy". Hilton plays Kitosch, who his mocked and abused by his ranch hand workmates, but its not long before he turns the tables and runs riot with the demented Wolff. Along the way there is revenge, robbery, betrayal and just about everything a good western should have. At the end of the day its Wolffs show, and what a show he gives.''

''Last of the Badmen is one of the best spaghetti-westerns I have ever seen. The description is not too difficult: Extremely cruel and sadistic italowestern, with cynicism brought on film length. George Hilton in one of his best performances. His role sways between a drunken ruffian, an aggressive revolver hero and a complete bastard. He plays Kitosch (a quite unusual name for a gunman), a cattle guardian at Don Jaimes (Eduardo Fajardo) ranch. When Kitosch is discovered with Don Jaimes wife (Pamela Tudor), he gets brand like an animal. But he succeeds in escaping. With the arrival in the next small town he tries to ask the sheriff for protection, because Don Jaime has put his men on Kitosch. However, instead of getting help, he is arrested and locked up to be delivered to Don Jaimes men. At this moment the hangdog Joshua Tracy (Frank Wolff), who is searched with the warrant of apprehension, appears. He kills the sheriff and his assistant and releases Kitosch. Together they are an unbeatable team. What do 2 criminals do? Clear, they commit crime. However, soon it turns out that Tracy isn't that cool like he appeared at the beginning. One could say, he is the perfect example of the devil. His preoccupation is to take revenge at his ex-wife and her new lover Big John. After Tracy has burned his former girlfriend, he is keen on killing Big John. Kitosch tries to repair the ill, aggressive impulses of his friend, however, only with little success. Finally, they want to visit Don Jaime and settle accounts with him, however, among them it comes more and more to differences... " The time of vultures " is a film with very good theatrical achievements of the principal characters and acts from the problems of human beings and morally questionable traits. George Hilton is convincing. In fact, Frank Wolff plays an unusual, unsympathetic role. But he is the one, who gives us a wonderful, show-stealing performance.''
