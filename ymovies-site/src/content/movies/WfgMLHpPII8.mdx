Reviews:
"Fiery blonde half-breed Yellow Hair (a winningly sassy and vibrant performance by the lovely Laurene Landon) and her easygoing cowpoke partner the Pecos Kid (a likable turn by Ken Roberson) are after a fortune in Mayan gold. The courageous duo have run-ins with an army of Mexican soldiers, a gang of dastardly bandits, and a lethal tribe of cunning Aztec warriors while searching the countryside for said gold. Director Matt Cimber, who also co-wrote the genial and eventful script with John Kershaw, relates the fun story at a steady pace, creates and sustains an engaging lighthearted tone, stages the thrilling action set pieces with gusto and competence, pays affectionate homage to the old-fashioned Western serials of yore, and further spruces things up with an amusing line in sharp cheeky humor. Moreover, the game cast have a field day with the breezy material: John Gharrari as fearsome Aztec chieftain Shayowteewah, Luis Lorento as the slimy and effeminate Colonel Torres, Aldo Sambrell as vicious mute bandit gang leader Flores, Claudia Gravy as Yellow Hair's wise Indian mother Grey Cloud, Ramiro Oliveros as mean saloon owner Tortuga, and Suzannah Woodside as brash saloon tart Rainbow. Appealing leads Landon and Roberson display a very nice and natural on-screen chemistry. John Cabrera's cinematography makes nifty use of wipes and strenuous slow motion. Franco Piersanti's spirited score hits the stirring spot. An extremely entertaining movie." Written by Woodyanders on IMDb.com
