<br />
Reviews:<br />
"This film gets a bad rap on reviews sites, but c'mon! You've got the director of the cheesy Psychic Killer dressed as an Indian, a Western slasher film that turns Rambo in the middle, then back to slasher mode again. This film is great!<br />
<br />
Our Final Girl is a gruff guide for a troop of Yankees who's having a really bad day. Not only was he attacked by a bear, he was mistaken for dead and chucked in a shallow grave by his mates. Worse still, Ray Danton's crazed Apache and his sidekicks are on the warpath. No gun fights here, per se – this is stalk and slashtastic!<br />
<br />
I got a bit worried when Danton seemingly killed all the Yankees in the space of the first half hour of this film, but this was when the guide turned the tables and started kicking Apache arse, setting cactus spike traps, and dropping rocks on people's heads.<br />
<br />
I also started to worry a bit when the last half hour of the film seemed to boil down to one guy chasing another guy through the desert, but I didn't find this at all boring. Check out the guide having a tantrum at a rattlesnake! Also, there's a grim ending and a head scratching epilogue.<br />
<br />
It looks to me like a lot of the gore was edited out of this film, although there's brief flashes here and there. Hardly any dialogue too, which may be why folks complain so much about this film. Well, that and the lack of any plot whatsoever. I enjoyed it, though. Don't go in expecting anything but a Z-grade Western slasher and you might like it too." Written by Bezenby <br />
