Reviews:
"I had the chance to see this great movie the other day. Everyone told me it was a great spaghetti-western, and I really think it is. And I'll tell you why. The plot of the film is very intriguing, the pacing is superb, and it's a story that could have happened somewhere in the west of the last century. It's just wonderful, great. And by the way it is also one of the first spaghetti westerns. Great performances by Richard Harrison, Mikaela, Daniel Martin and the rest of the cast make this film absolutely delightful. And to top it off the main title song called "A gringo like me" is one of the best pieces I have ever heard in a western of this type: "Put your hand on your gun...don't you trust anyone, there's just one kind of man that you can trust, that's a dead man...or a gringo like me...". Written by f.gimenez on IMDb.com.

"Gunfight At Red Sands is an excellent early spaghetti western. It's probably the best pre-1964 Eurowestern I've seen.

I wouldn't be surprised if this spaghetti was the one that started it all, style-wise. The other early examples of the genre I've seen seem to lack the defining characteristics that make these films so great, but this film has all the stylistic elements in place. The depiction of life in the west, a couple of oddball characters, a great score (by the master Morricone, no less), great suspenseful camera work, a dramatic showdown, and plenty of action make this film stand out.

The acting in the film is very good, and definitely above average for a Eurowestern. Richard Harrison is great in the role of "Gringo". Giacomo Rossi-Stuart also does an excellent job in the role of Sheriff Corbett. All the other actors are also very good. The character of "Lisa", played by Sara Lezana, is one of the strongest female characters I have ever seen in a western. She is as tough and can shoot as well as any character in the story, and has a very prominent role in the film's major action scenes.

The story is very engaging and moves along at a very good pace. There are no slow or filler parts in this film. There is also a strong mystery element, as Gringo has to do a fair amount of detective work to find out who murdered his father.

All in all, this is a great film that no spaghetti western fan should pass up." Written by spider89119 at IMDb.com.
