Story:
There is nothing wrong with chasing the past so long as the past holds the key to one's freedom. Ransom, a retired contract scout for the union, is compelled to confront the dark tragedy of his past so he can find happiness in the future. He sets out to find out what really happened to his true love Tess and her little girl Promise after he shipped out with his regiment to take the last surrender of the Johnny Reb's outfits. He arrives at the ranch to find Zacharias, the new ranch owner, who tells the story of his true love's horrible fate and the last known location of her daughter. Wrought with emotion Ransom rides out to Las Cruces for answers. Meanwhile, ex-confederate marauders battle to the death as they try to find the cash box that was dug up on the ranch 12 years ago and now rumored to be in Mexico. Wildeye, a strange menacing man, holds the personal records of his late brother's exploits and the whereabouts of the buried cash box. The only problem is there is a page missing from the records. Determined to find the gold, Wildeye will stop at nothing to get his hands on it. Nothing. When Ransom rides into the town of Las Cruces he is approached by a young woman who reveals herself as Promise Sawyer. Although, he does not understand what her obsession is with getting to the cash box first, he obliges. Together they embark on a deadly journey with gunfight battles, double crosses, and an unexpected showdown.
