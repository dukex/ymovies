Reviews:<br />
"This is the last of D'Amato's Westerns, and the last time (1974) he made a film which could possibly be described as family entertainment – a rollicking boy's own adventure about a Mountie in pursuit of the villain who has kidnapped his son. Yet beneath the usual Saturday morning at the pictures thrills – the cloying kid, the brave dog, the gunfights and the quirky supporting characters, there are intriguing and troubling strands which prevent the story becoming just another good versus evil Manichaean morality tale.<br />
The film rattles along at a good pace, includes some beautifully choreographed and edited gunfights, has a wonderful turn from Lionel Stander as a drunken doctor and, most strikingly, takes place for the most part against a backdrop of snow covered mountains, beautifully photographed. This snow-setting makes the story elemental, as the characters enact out their Freud-tinged rivalries in the face of a cold, careless, barren and unblinking natural world."<br />
