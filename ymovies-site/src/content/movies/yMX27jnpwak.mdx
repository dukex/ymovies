A Few Dollars for Django (1966), Pochi dollari per Django (original title), Crime, Full Western Movie, Full Length Cowboy Film, English, Spaghetti Western. A Few Dollars for Django (Italian: Pochi dollari per Django) is a 1966 Italian Spaghetti Western film directed by León Klimovsky and starring Anthony Steffen. Although he was credited as a second unit director, Enzo G. Castellari directed a main part of the film. The film's title was meant to evoke the recent Spaghetti Westerns For a Few Dollars More (1965) and Django (1966), although A Few Dollars for Django has no direct connection to either one; there is no character in the film named Django.

Sent to Montana to hunt down bank robbers, a bounty hunter takes the star off a replacement sheriff who didn't reach his destination and steps into a range war between farmers and cattlemen.
