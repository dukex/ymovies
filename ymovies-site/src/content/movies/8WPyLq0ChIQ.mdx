Synopsis:
Although Buck Sinclair (Kermit Maynard) is in love with Beth Ringold (Mary Hayes), her father George Ringold (Sam Flint)is one of his most bitter enemies; he is bent on Beth marrying "Mile-a-Way" Roberts (John Merton), his conniving partner. Buck leases some very valuable government grazing land, which Ringold and Roberts are anxious to obtain since their ranch land is barren. When Buck's lease expire, Ringold instructs the local bank, in which he is the largest stockholder, not to underwrite Buck's bid. But "Wildcat" Roper (Budd Buster), a rancher who fears Ringold will freeze him and other ranchers out if he gains control of Buck's lease, comes to Buck's aid. Roberts imports "Sundown" (Earle Hodgins), a professional gunman to get rid of Buck.

Reviews:
"Great action in this 30's western fare. With names like Mile-a-way Roberts and Wildcat Roper, Six Guns had the flavor of a great early western. I wish Kermit Maynard would've had more leading roles as he delivered nicely in this one. The same holds true for Mary Hayes who had a more limited role but showed she had star power. Of course Earle Hodgins, Sam Flint, and John Merton gave the usual great performances. But I thought the Wildcat Roper part played by Bud Buster stole the show with his wit and high energy performance. Roaring Six Guns is a roaring high energy film worth seeing."
