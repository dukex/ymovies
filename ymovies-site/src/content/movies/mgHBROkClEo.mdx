The pitiless gang of the notorious Mexican bandit, Monetero, attacks a gold-laden railway convoy, unbeknownst to them, however, that the dauntless bounty hunter in black known as the "Stranger" is after them. But, shiny gold is always tempting, and as one of the thieves hides the loot, the hunter decides to team up with his prey after saving him from the gallows, and Clayton, a duplicitous bank employee, joins Monetero and the Stranger in a dangerous treasure hunt. Now, the reluctant companions are in search of a fragmented medallion that leads to the hidden treasure. Will they find the gold, and live to tell the tale?

Reviews:
"Leonard Maltin gave this film a dreaded BOMB rating in his 1995 Movie and Video Guide. What film was he looking at? Kid Vengeance or God's Gun are bombs. This film is a delight. It is fantastic. It is literate. It is well mounted. It is beautiful photographed, making a brilliant use of colors. Right from the opening scene the film grabs your attention and tips you off that this film is a well-done satire of the whole Spaghetti Western genre. The film is played for laughs from the beginning to the end with homages to Douglas Fairbanks, 77 Sunset Strip, and the famous showdown in the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. Edd Byrnes, George Hilton, and Gilbert Roland work brilliantly together to make the satire work. It is too bad Mr. Maltin rated this film so poorly as it is undeserved. One can only guess as to his reason. I suspect that he missed the point of the movie entirely and was expecting something more serious than this film is meant to be. Kudos belong to everyone involved in this project. This film is a little gem waiting to be discovered by people who care about literate movies and appreciate satire."
