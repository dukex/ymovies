Storyline:
Scout and wagon-train guide Kirby Randolph hates all Indians, particularly Kiowa Chief Satank, whose massacre of an entire wagon-train of settlers led by Kirby, has led to his ostracism and neither he nor his pal Sam Beekman can get jobs. Aurelie St. Clair, who owns half of an ammunition shipment for sale in Santa Fe to Mexican insurrectionaries, protests when he partner Jess Griswold hires Kirby and Sam as guides. When Kirby saves them all from a wild horse stampede instigated by Satank, she changes her mind and she and Kirby fall in love, although Kirby does not realize she is half-Indian. Jess, who is also in love with Aurelie and wanting to get rid of Kirby, sends his servant Chavez to Satank offering to deliver Kirby to the Chief in return for safe passage for the wagon train. But, Satank plans to get both Kirby and the wagon train.

Reviews:
"Once again, Republic Studio brings together a great cast in a superior Western tale. Payne is the discredited scout, Pickens his side-kick, hired to guide a wagon full of guns through hostile Indian territory. As the action unfolds, Payne must overcome the hostiles, gun-runners and his own prejudice to win out. There is a lot of suspense here, and never a dull moment. An excellent watch!"

Warning: Spoilers
"Although this is director William Witney's best film, it seems to have been overlooked by most critics, including Paul Simpson who doesn't even mention Witney at all in his "Rough Guide to Westerns" (2006). This film, however, stars John Payne, then at the height of his box office appeal, thanks to vigorous promoting by Howard Hughes at RKO. Yet somehow the Payne name didn't work its usual magic. In fact, the movie suffered a bad break right from the beginning. Although it was made on an "A" budget, it wasn't even released in New York. Consequently, no reviews from the country's most prestigious critics. Even a thumbs down collection of reviews from New York is better than no reviews at all. Anyway, although there are a few obvious studio scenes, this little gem was photographed for the most part on actual locations in Utah. Director Witney and his photographer make such atmospheric use of desert browns and reds sharply outlined against powerful blue skylines, the film is always a wonder to look at. It's chock full of action and great stunts (never mind that some of the stunt players are a little too obvious at times), but nevertheless directed with a bit of style as well as pace and vigor. The interesting support cast lines up Rod Cameron – playing the heavy for once – and Leo Gordon giving his usual vigorous study in villainy. No expense was spared on full throttle running inserts for the action spots." Written by JohnHowardReid on IMDb.com.
