Little Rita kills Ringo and Django, but she is taken prisoner by the Mexican bandit Sancho who wants to steal her gold. Black Star rescues her and seems determined to help her, but does he?<br />
<br />
Reviews:<br />
"The 'Spaghetti Western' fan's Bible, 'The Good, The Bad and The Violent' by Thomas Weisser really gives this movie a hard time, even voting it one of the Top 10 Worst Spaghetti Westerns Of All Time(No.9 to be exact)...but that's all a little too harsh. Compared to the Franco and Ciccio efforts, or any movie by Demofilo Fidani, or indeed any of the cheap, shoddy Sartana cash-ins; this is quite a solid little movie.<br />
<br />
And it's good for a laugh.<br />
<br />
Weisser and his cohorts even admit that the sequences in the movie featuring Django are quite droll. As are the scenes with Johnny Ringo and Black Star(called Black 'Stand' in the subtitles of the version I watched). Indeed, the scenes which parody the Spaghetti Western cliches are extremely stylish and very well done.<br />
<br />
The song and dance numbers, often cut from American prints, are quite bizarre and I feel that this movie would be better served on a double-bill with 'Head', the Monkees movie.<br />
<br />
A word of warning though, if you see this movie on the Japanese DVD then you'd be as well turning the English Subtitles OFF if you want to follow the plot as they make no sense whatsoever...especially in the lyrics to the songs. Or keep them on and get an extra few laughs for your money.<br />
<br />
All in all I enjoyed this fun movie and it's certainly an alternative to, say, the vile misogyny of something like Cut-Throats Nine." written by Poison-River on IMDb.com<br />
<br />
"Fun little movie that pokes fun at many other spaghetti westerns -- and movies in general. The script is uneven, but most of the (in) jokes are fun. Lots of references to semi-famous western movie titles, scenes, and characters... Terence Hill doesn't do much, the real star is Rita Pavone in this one. I won't spoil it for you, just try and find it, some scenes are worth it -- when you're feelin' stupid!" Written by humanoidzombie on IMDb.com<br />
