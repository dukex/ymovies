Storyline:
During the gold rush days a wagon train is attacked by a gang of renegades. John Knox is killed and one of his young sons, Asa Knox, is kidnapped by the renegade leader. The other son, Clint, and his mother Martha escape and reach St. Joseph, Missouri. Clint grows up and becomes a crack rider for the Pony Express. The kidnapped brother, now known as Ace Carter, has been raised by the outlaws with a contempt for the law. He is an unsuccessful rival of Clint's for the Pony Express job, which fosters enmity between them. Ace holds up a stagecoach on which Martha Knox and Clint's sweetheart, Mary West, are passengers. Clint takes the trail and runs him down. Clint later learns Ace's true identity and saves him from a lynch mob. Because of the circumstances, Ace's captors relent, and the two brothers and their mother are reunited.

Reviews:
"Forget the pretentious title, but don't forget to watch this movie, first chance you get. It is volume three of a set called "Legends Of the West," one of those compilations filled, mostly, with junk but, every now and then featuring some gems.

"Cavalcade Of the West" is the brightest gem. It stars a real cowboy, Hoot Gibson, who looks more like a mild-mannered office clerk. Looks deceive. Watch how he mounts and rides his horse - and watch how he emotes in a part that calls for heart.

You have to pay close attention from beginning to end to fully appreciate this beautiful story, and how it is told. I don't choke up easily, but this movie captured my emotions.

It was made in '36 so it is a little creaky. It goes for the familiar every now and then, but there is nothing in it that is not important, nothing that will not capture your heart and fascinate you.

The movie was a total surprise and a most pleasant one. Gibson and Rex Lease are excellent and, by the way, too many of the few reviews gave away way too much of the plot. These guys are fascinated by their prose.

Bottom line: If you can get your hands on this Platinum release (P.O. Box 2798 in La Crosse, Wisconsin 54602) grab it. I paid $5 for mine at a Big Lots.

As far as I'm concerned, this is a must-see which you will want to see, and savor, several times."
