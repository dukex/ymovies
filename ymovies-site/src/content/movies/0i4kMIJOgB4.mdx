Story: 
Leslie Caron is Sister Mary, the sole survivor of an Apache attack on a wagon train. She’s left to roam the countryside on a mule, trying to find her way to Sante Fe, when she comes across a gunman named Madron (Richard Boone). At first, he wonders what he’s gotten into, what with Sister Mary’s grand hours of silence, her insistence on burying the badest of bad men and her Friday fasts, even when she’s starving. But he soon grows more than a little fond of her, thanks in part to her surprising frontier moxy. Complicating matters are some Mexican bandits and a Apache named Sam Red. He and Madron have a violent history that has both men seeking vengeance. 

Review: 
The movie is enthralling, it has deepness, it is the hard core gunfighter who has lost all hope on mankind, including himself, and trapped by circumstances in a desert with a beautiful pure woman...and slowly regains hope in mankind, in himself, and ultimately falls in love...his last love...and sacrifices his life so that she may live...all enshrined in the nostalgic spell of the award winning score...a beautiful movie...
