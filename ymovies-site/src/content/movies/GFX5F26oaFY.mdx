Review:
Aussie cinematic gold......
Again and again, Australia proves it has an exceptional talent, for crafting quality cinema.
Goldstone is yet another real Aussie gem of a film. Its a story that has depth and beauty, juxtaposed by self effacing, unapologetic, honesty. A reflection, in many ways, of the stark Australian outback, in which it is set.
There's a good detective drama on offer here too, backed by a really soulful, back story. A story that, in a straightforward but touching way, draws the viewers attention to the sad reality of life, for minorities and those marginalized by society.
Aaron Pedersen has much to be proud of in the lead role as police officer Jay Swan. Like the film itself, his performance is understated, yet, at times, almost inexplicably moving. The other cast members distinguish themselves too, including Alex Russell, who plays Swan's local police counterpart, Josh.
In short Goldstone is remarkably well written, directed and acted. True Aussie cinematic gold. Nine out of ten from me.
