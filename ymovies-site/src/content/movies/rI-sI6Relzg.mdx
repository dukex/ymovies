Story:
Johnny Ringo is a Texas Ranger out to stop a counterfeiting ring. However, a large part of the story (and of the efforts of the hero) instead involves a triangle drama between big boss Jackson, the rancher Ray Scott, saloon singer Annie – mistress to the former and lover of the latter – and by way of Ray also his sister Christine. The connection of this to the mission of the hero is that Ray may be convinced to testify against Jackson. The real counterfeit artist turns out to be the sheriff - Ringo's partner to the investigation.

Review:
A Texas Ranger comes into Eagle Pass to find a gang of counterfeiters. What he really walks into is a town run by that very gang. Can he bring the gang to justice or will he get himself killed in the process?
Lots of actions and gunfights and some pretty good acting. Written by RonTron5000 on letterboxd.com
