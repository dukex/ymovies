Warning: Spoilers<br />
"George (likable John Fordyce) and John McIntire (the equally engaging Chris Chittell) are a couple of naive brothers who travel to a lawless western town to see their father. The bumbling siblings find themselves in big trouble after they beat up a member of a gang of extortionists. Fortunately, shrewd and lethal mysterious gunfighter Camposanto (the great Gianno Garko, as smooth and charismatic as ever) decides to help the guys out of their jam by teaching them how to fend for themselves. Director Giuliano Carnimeo, working from a blithely silly and playful script by Enzo Barboni, relates the breezy story at a constant brisk pace, maintains a properly lighthearted tone throughout, and stages the wacky slapstick brawls and energetic shoot-outs with real verve (the climactic thrilling and dynamic confrontation between our heroes and the bad guys in particular seriously smokes). William Berger delivers a terrifically assured and commanding performance as crafty and deadly rival gunslinger Duke; the easy and natural chemistry between Berger and Garko makes all their scenes together a total pleasure to watch. Bruno Nicolai's rousing, twangy, and spirited score hits the stirring spot. Stelvio Massi's lively widescreen cinematography boasts a lots of crazy zooms and fierce pans. An immensely enjoyable and often amusing comedic romp." Written by Woodyanders on IMDb.com<br />
<br />
"This one's a keeper! Mega-stylish fun from Guiliano Carnimeo, who would also give us The Case of the Bloody Iris, one of the best gialli around. This time he's got two (camp) brothers heading from the East back to their dad's ranch, who's having trouble with an extortion racket. The brothers are absolutely crap at everything, so luckily for them dark stranger Ace (Gianni Garko) comes to their aid. Unluckily for them, the bad guys have hired William Berger to kill them.<br />
<br />
Garko shows the two fops how to mete out justice in the Wild West, while Berger sits around moodily waiting to pop a cap in their behinds. He's got this little collapsible whiskey cup, that, when folded up and put away, is a signal that someone nearby is going to shortly resemble a colander. Berger and Garko have a mutual respect for each other which is played rather nicely through the film. <br />
<br />
There's plenty of gunfights here, a bit of slapstick, and your usual big fight at the end. If you can get over some of the broad comedy (a trend in these flicks) you'll have a good time here." Written by Bezenby<br />
