Synopsis:<br />
Jim Redfern dreams of owning his own cattle ranch and along with his partners Mike Evans and Ling heads off on the Cariboo Trail into the interior of British Columbia. There's a gold rush on and along the way they're joined by old-timer Grizzly Winters, a prospector who hasn't had much luck of late. They soon come up against Frank Walsh whose men stampede their cattle. Evans is severely injured forcing Redfern to amputate his left arm. Evans hates him for that and will have nothing to do with him or his dream of the cattle ranch. Walsh owns the local town making it difficult for Redfern to get re-established. Things begin to go his way when he finds gold.<br />

Reviews:<br />
Randolph Scott heads up a wonderful cast of well know western actors. Gabby Hayes ended his movie career on a high note with a most appropriate moniker of Grizzly. Dale Robertson and soap opera star Mary Stuart have a nice romantic sub plot and Bill Williams plays a powerful role as the partner gone bad. Leading lady Karin Booth was superb as the woman caught in a love triangle with Scott and the villain we love to hate Victor Jory. As for the great action, no one plays better henchmen than Douglas Kennedy and Jim Davis. I loved the cinecolor production but I would love to see the original release version which was black and white. Other noteworthy performances were by Mary Kent, Lee Tong Foo and James Griffith. An exciting story line of cattle driving and gold prospecting combined with a great cast of stars makes The Cariboo Trail an excellent film.<br />
