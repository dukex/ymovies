Reviews:<br />
"One of the reviewers here thinks it probably is. I agree. I have only watched it twice in my life and I regret it did not have the same impact on me then as it does now in 2020. It is a film that surpasses the word masterpiece, which even I confess to using perhaps too often. It surpasses this very debatable category by reminding us in powerful cinematic terms of a) what it means to live at subsistence level and b) shows us that giving to others without thought of gain is the most precious action in life. Covid-19 should be reminding us of this, but some individual countries like individual people are deliberately failing in seeing this. Sadly some will see this as being ant-Capitalist. I see it as resisting the best quality that we have within us; the quality of unconditional humanity and world friendship. Renoir shows in image after image how the so-called stronger can help those less fortunate to survive. Zachary Scott, an underrated actor, gives an Oscar winning performance. His acting in this film showed a naturalness that was way ahead of its time. And what is most amazing is his sexual presence, close to the earth itself and to the very core of life. I believed in the sexual love between himself and his wife played by the equally great Betty Field. Henry Fonda, Gary Cooper, Gregory Peck, all favourites of the time would have acted; Zachary Scott just is and it was not until the likes of James Dean would that sort of presence be seen on the screen. I hope that is partly why Renoir considered it to be the best of his American films. Renoir's films flow, very much like the river in this film and in my second preferred film of his ' The River '. Scott and Field have this fluidity and their love of the earth itself and the waters that cover it and nourish it are beautifully conveyed. Watch the unforgiving waters at the end of the film and their reactions to it to see that we should accept all that nature itself gives, and to live within this natural rhythm and to survive."
