Riding toward Santa Fe, Tom Crenshaw shoots a bushwhacker who has killed Dad Bates from ambush. Discovering a money belt on Bates, Tom carries it to town, along with a letter he finds in the pocket of the killer, which offers him the means of identifying either of the dead men. In town, Tom has a run-in with gunman One-Shot Morgan and one of Morgan's henchmen sees Tom with the money belt. Tom poses as the renegade who did the killing and is accepted by Morgan and his gang. Tom's plan is working until one of the gang who knew the killer shows up and denounces him as an impostor.<br />

Reviews:<br />
""Santa Fe Bound" (1936) stars Tom Tyler in a really fine "B" Western. His real-life, then-wife Jeanne Martel plays the owner of a ranch that is being underhandedly manipulated away from her father, though her father is killed off within the first five minutes. Now she's in charge. The rest of the show is about Tom's finding out who's behind the nefarious deeds and resolving the mess. Of course, who do you think he ends up with? Right.<br />
<br />
Nicely done oater that is one of the best Tyler Westerns I've seen. Acting is top notch most of the way around. A couple of the bad guys probably shouldn't have been given any lines to speak. Otherwise, a fine Western I'd watch again. Also in the show are Richard Cramer (really fine actor in a nasty part! who appeared in 258 films!), Slim Whitaker (350 movie credits!! and almost always a bad guy in Westerns) in a part that within ten minutes of the beginning of the film makes you want to continue to watch, Ed Cassidy (260 film credits), Lafe McKee (337 feature film credits and still counting, 112 short film credits!), Dorothy Wood, Charles King (367 feature film credits, 58 short film credits!), and Earl Dwire (156 film credits). Dorothy Wood plays a crotchety Scottish housekeeper and she's incredibly charming, resourceful, and a lot of fun. For the record, the bad guys (Cramer, Whitaker, Cassidy, and King) define the "B" Western baddies of nearly 40 years of this kind of film. Here, interestingly enough, Earl Dwire surprisingly plays a good guy! Only once or twice otherwise did he ever do that. Lafe McKee plays a sheriff: imagine that! It sometimes seems that if McKee isn't in a "B" Western it's because he was too busy making another one at some other studio.<br />
<br />
Overall, superior of its "B" type. Very much recommended for Western enthusiasts of 30s "B"s."<br />
