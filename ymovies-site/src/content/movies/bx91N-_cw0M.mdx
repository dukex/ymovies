Storyline:
The eldest daughter of a pioneer family is kidnapped by a mysterious Indian tribe and the eldest son pursues. In order to win back his sister's freedom, he must sacrifice his own life by passing the test of "Crooked Sky" and shield his sister from an executioner's arrow. Along the way, he recruits a broken down, drunk prospector to help him track down the unknown tribe and rescue his sister.

Review:
This movie was released in the summer before my tenth birthday. It, along with "Where the Red Fern Grows," was one of the most moving movies I saw in my pre-teens. Coincidentally, Stewart Petersen starred in both films, so it may have been a quality in his character that particularly influenced me. Coincidentally, this same actor's portrayal of the young Joseph Smith in "The First Vision," which I saw two years later during a trip through Salt Lake City, changed my life forever. "Against a Crooked Sky" evokes all the most tender emotions and inspiration of high ideals. I haven't seen it again in the almost twenty years since then, so the fact that I remember this movie is a tribute to the lasting impression it is able to leave on young viewers. written by Xiaopangzi
