<br />
Two vagabonds save the life of a Mexican and discover he has a tattooed map on his back. A second treasure map (tattooed on another man's back) is needed to find the gold. The three are joined by a mean, lean cardsharp, who has been eavesdropping on them and also wants a slice of the cake. A fair adventure movie with a good cast (Fajardo steals the show in a rare positive role as a comical sidekick) but the narrative is a bit of a grab bag. The film also features one of the most melodramatic death scenes you'll ever see in a spaghetti western.<br />
