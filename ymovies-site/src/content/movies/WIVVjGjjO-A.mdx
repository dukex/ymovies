Reviews:
"I was really surprised at how well constructed this one was, but not overly so, as I'm a fan of the director's other Spaghetti Westerns. Great plot without twists and turns for their own sake; simple yet compelling, it drives the action along. A fan of the Zapatista subgenre, I really enjoyed watching this.

And then I had to wonder about why it's not rated higher. Bottom line, I think it's a lot like recipe sites. Many simple, really tasty recipes are overlooked because snooty types see certain elements- or are offended that certain elements aren't just the way the book says they should be- without ever evaluating the bottom line; "Does it work? Is it tasty? Is it good cooking?" That's too bad, because they rob themselves of so much doing that.

Fans of the genre won't want to miss it. Casual observers of the genre will enjoy it. The snooty will always find a way to make themselves bored and miserable." Written by adrianswingler on IMDb.com.

"I was so impressed with the 1969 "Night of the Serpents". People will think, I am crazy but this movie is as good as Death Rides a Horse but not better. I believe this movie is underrated and if watched by more SW fans it would be easy a top 20. The music by Riz Ortolani, who did Beyond the Law, Day of Anger as well as many others was amazing throughout this movie he definitely in my opinion can hang with Bacalov, Morricone, Pregadio, etc. The director Guilio Petroni famous for Death Rides a Horse is top notch also in this one and to me is among the top directors in the genre.

It's a story of relatives who are set to inherit 10,000 dollars and one accidentally murders a dispatcher with a telegram the heavy bad guy in it is no other than Luigi Pistilli, who plays the Federale Lt. Hernandez, who is just as rotten as the bunch of relatives for he too wants the money. One by one the four relatives die but before there deaths Lt. Hernandez wanted a gunmen to finish off a fifth relative so he visits an old acquaintance a bandit leader named Bogardo who gives him the drunkard Luke Askew, who was very good as the indifferent self loathing drunk haunted by his past as a cocky show off exceptional with a gun, I do not want to spoil it but Luke does something to make himself the drunk he is today. I really loved the flashbacks of his character to make you feel more connected with the character to see who he was and what made him a drunk. The bad scene, I don't want to spoil makes sense with the connection and protection of the fifth relative a young boy. I feel the child actor did a descent job and was a good fit for the movie. The movie had a nice pace to it with story and action and overall very solid, I was not bored at all. Check this one out you will not be sorry..." Written by tcaramela on IMDb.com.
