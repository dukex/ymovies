Reviews:
Warning: Spoilers
"Suave gambler Clay Watson (smoothly played by the always excellent John Saxon), cocky sharpshooter Moses Lang (a lively turn by Antonio Sabato), and wily thespian Edwin Kean (a fine and likable performance by Frank Wolff) are a trio of criminals in the Old West. The motley threesome are forced to make an uneasy alliance in order to find $400,000 dollars in stolen money. Director Enzo Castellari, working from a breezy script by Augusto Finocchi, Vittorio Metz, and Jose Maria Rodriguez, relates the blithely goofy story at a constant snappy pace, maintains a properly lighthearted tone throughout, and stages the rousing shoot-outs and plentiful rough'n'ready fisticuffs with real skill and aplomb. The broad slapstick gags are admittedly quite silly (the scenes with Kean brazenly impersonating a priest are especially funny), but still get big laughs just the same. Saxon, Sabato, and Wolff all make for engaging leads; their nice and natural on-screen chemistry keeps things bubbling along. Moreover, there are sturdy supporting contributions from the fetching Agata Flori as fierce spitfire Rosario and Leo Anchoriz as ruthless bandito gang leader Garrito. Longtime favorite character actor Victor Israel has a nifty bit as a chef. Both Alejandro Ulloa's crisp widescreen cinematography and Carlo Rusticello's jaunty, harmonic score do the trick. A fun flick." Written by Woodyanders on IMDb.com
