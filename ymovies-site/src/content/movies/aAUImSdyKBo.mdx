<br />
Storyline:<br />
Anthony Steffan is Davy Flanagan, a former Union officer who was part of an attempt to break out of a Confederate prison camp during the Civil War and suffered a blow to the head that left him with amnesia.<br />
<br />
Then a bounty hunter shows up to collect a bounty on his head as a deserter. Davy manages another escape.<br />
<br />
In the process, he discovers that the secret to his past might be found in the town of Dixon.<br />
<br />
Once there, he’s scorned by townsfolk who have also heard of his desertion. In fact, rumor has it he deserted the Union army and became commander of a Rebel prisoner of war camp.<br />
<br />
But he finds one man who professes to be his friend: Sam Kellogg (William Berger).<br />
<br />
Of course, Kellogg also spirits Clay Hackett (Claudio Undari) out of town quickly because he’s living with Davy’s wife Lisa (Ida Galli). And he lures Davy into a trap that could lead to the gallows.<br />
<br />
Ah, but Davy escapes yet again. Next stop: Goldfield, a town ruled by bandit Crazy Joe and his men. And this time, he’s taking Sam Kellogg along for the ride. Written by Mark Franklin on http://onceuponatimeinawestern.com<br />

Reviews:<br />
Warning: Spoilers<br />
"Anthony Steffen, William Berger, Mario Brega: Steffen plays a Union officer (Davy Flanagan) who was shot by a POW camp commander (later revealed to by William Berger) who pretends to be his friend, Sam Kellogg. Due to this head wound, Davy lost all memory of his past. Davy discovers that he is considered a deserter and has a high bounty ($10,000!) on his head. While seeking his beautiful wife, Liza, (Ida Galli aka Evelyn Stewart) who had since become the common law wife to Clay Hackett (Claudio Undari aka Robert Hundar). Liza spends most of her days drinking bottles of liquor and passing out.<br />
<br />
Dragging Kellogg around, Davy fights off bandit gangs (one led by "Jack", Raf Baldarassarre) and kills them all. Dirty (Mario Brega) is a bandit leader want-to-be, who gets dispatched as well. In the final showdown with Hackett's gang and Kellogg, Davy destroys them all with nitro and flying bullets. After Kellogg hits Davy in the head, his memories return, and Kellogg is shot dead and falls into a horse trough. At the end, Liza and Davy are reunited hand in hand.<br />
<br />
Although Kellogg says that he has an account to settle with Davy, there is no sense in that motive. How would a man who shot an enemy soldier and then masqueraded as a Union soldier by wearing his uniform, have such a hate agenda for man that never did anything to him? Obviously, this paper thin motivational character trope turns up all the time in SW's. Overall, the amnesia plot with Steffen works well here, and we can enjoy plenty of action and a rare romantic happy ending." Written by marthahunter on IMDb.com.<br />
