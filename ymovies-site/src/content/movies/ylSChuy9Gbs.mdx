Reviews:
"For more than three decades western movies ruled supreme but during the mid 70’s the genre was blowing out its last fart. Sergio Corbucci successfully directed, for a decade long, westerns and The White, The Yellow and The Black is his last western, a parody on the genre. After this until his death in 1990, Corbucci made nothing but comedies. With the Bud Spencer/Terence Hill ones being the most famous. WYB was part of Corbucci’s western comedies wich all bombed. This third one a stars Eli Wallach and my favorite Italian actor Tomas Milian. Milian portrays a Japanese samurai, a shameless and grotesque stereotype of a performance. It is so over the top you have to laugh with it. Grunting, making stupid noises all the time and using a gibberish Japanese language. His performance is more based on kungfu comedies and the way he looks is completely ridiculous. The plot is another kind of dumb. A pony that gets worshipped by the Japanese gets kidnapped and ransom is asked. It is up to Eli Wallach playing a Sheriff to get the pony out and paying the ransom money. On the way he meets a known outlaw and a samurai. I quite liked this dumb shit as many of the western tropes are parodied with amusing results. The soundtrack is also a great joy."
