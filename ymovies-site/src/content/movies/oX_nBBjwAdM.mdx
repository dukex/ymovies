Reviews:<br />
"Of Course there are better, but I know a lot of spaghetti-western which are unbelievable worst. To start to write about the story is to explain the whole movie. It is a simple one, like other spaghetti-western, Arizona (the typical antihero) against a bunch of bandits. His funny sidekick has a silly name: Double Whiskey. You will see humor, cold blooded killing, torture and a lot of shooting. So everything someone can expect from an average spaghetti-western. There is nothing in this movie, you couldn't see in other spaghetti-western.<br />
<br />
"Arizona Colt Returns", or whatever the name is, is not a bad one, but it isn't a good one either. For spaghetti-western standards the violence is normal and not too brutal. So it isn't an ugly dirty one either. What is the best of this western? Maybe Anthony Steffen (or Anthonio De Teffé) as Arizona, but I liked his sidekick Double-Whiskey too. There are some scenes where these 2 characters are really funny together. I liked to watch the beautiful and good actress Rosalba Neri. Some more scenes with her would be helpful for this movie. Sometimes it seems that Rosalba was a little bit underchallenged in her role. Most of the other actors you have already seen in Movies made in Italy from that period. The sounds of composer Bruno Nicolai are great in this movie. Maybe the music is too good for a cheap movie like that.<br />
<br />
Overall I must say that "Arizona Colt Returns" was entertaining. And I think this is the most important thing about a movie like this. I had the luck to watch this movie with a not so poor quality. When you are someone who likes Western from Europe (even the worst), then you will enjoy "Arizona Colt Returns"." Written by lostinaction on IMDb.com<br />

Warning: Spoilers<br />
"During the first few minutes, the movie seems to be a comedy, introducing Double Whiskey (Roberto Camardiel) and the lazy gunman Arizona Colt (Anthony Steffen) who does not even pick up a job for a lot of money. Yet it soon turns into a serious and violent western, a typical production for its time and the genre debut of "Mannaja" director Sergio Martino. Intended to be a sequel to "Arizona Colt" with Giuliano Gemma, it has little in common with the earlier movie, since Anthony Steffen plays a slower, darker, heavier type of character.
