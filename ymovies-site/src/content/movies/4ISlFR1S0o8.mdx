Storyline:<br />
Johnnie loves his train ("The General") and Annabelle Lee. When the Civil War begins he is turned down for service because he's more valuable as an engineer. Annabelle thinks it's because he's a coward. Union spies capture The General with Annabelle on board. Johnnie must rescue both his loves. Written by Ed Stephan <br />

Reviews:<br />
"Buster Keaton's acclaimed Civil War comedy, often ranked among the best films ever made, highlights all the virtues of a Keaton feature: beautiful photography; unique construction (being in this instance a mirror pair of equally inventive locomotive chases); daring stunts; and, of course, Keaton's always unexpected, perfectly timed humor. The film is also a convincing slice of antebellum Americana, with Buster stepping out of a Matthew Brady photograph to play a Confederate railroad engineer who rescues his beloved locomotive (and his almost-as-beloved girlfriend) from Union Army hijackers. The film is occasionally more thrilling than funny, but the thrills, at least, are honest: when the Rock River Bridge collapses under the Union train, nothing is faked. This is the most familiar of Keaton's classic comedies, and the frequency of revival (for a silent film) has had some adverse side effects: before the development of DVD technology most of then surviving prints were in pretty poor condition."

"i have always loved buster keaton movies, but this one is my absolute favorite of his, i remember seeing it a couple years ago, and remembered about a while ago a have been looking for it for along time, and then i finally found it yesterday at my library, and got it and i loved more than i think i did before, and buster keaton is great in it, i think it would have been a lot harder to be a good actor then because there was no sound or anything, and he did a wonderful job of acting without using his voice or anything by using his body, definitely one of the best physical actors ever!!! so if u haven't seen this movie i strongly recommend you do" Written by Dead_Mann on IMDb.com<br />
