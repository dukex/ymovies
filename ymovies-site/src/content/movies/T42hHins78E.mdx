Storyline:<br />
A traveling gravedigger during an (unspecified) war adopts a orphan he finds alone in the desert.

The orphan wants to make one big score by robbing a bank but the gravedigger resists. Their dream is to open a fancy funeral parlor and cemetery. The orphan becomes obsessed with a prostitute he saw who was later abandoned by her outlaw partner after a robbery attempt on a gold wagon goes bad. He eventually leaves the gravedigger to find her.<br />

Reviews:<br />
"Fans of Heavy Metal series "Hombre" by Antonio Segura, Luc Besson's "Le Dernier Combat", or the cult classic "Zachariah" looking for a similar romp in the hay from a movie will find this strange euro spaghetti western to be a pleasure to their violent and strange taste. It quickly establishes our anti-hero Johnny--who is an uncanny double for Peter Fonda in Clint Eastwood garb, from a babe in the desert with one of the coolest violent beginnings to a film since "The Sorcerer" with Roy Schieder, to a young gunslinger adopted by the area's undertaker. I won't detail the plot because I think for most of us who will enjoy the movie the mystery of what will happen next, and what rogue's gallery of characters will be added, are the whole reason for watching. This movie really does take some strange turns as it wanders through the desert underworld. One should probably suspend disbelief, fore continuity, rationality, character motivation, and Oscar performances this film does not have. However, in the world it creates for that 90 minutes, everything makes complete sense. For a time this film is showing on Joox." Written by nckmnsll on IMDb.com<br />
