Synopsis:<br />
The line between the good guys and the bad guys blurs as ruthless bounty hunters No Name and Dynamite Davenport shoot their way through the Wild West, collecting rewards and making more enemies than friends. With the outlaw John Wilkes Booth on the run and gold hidden in the hills, justice must be served.<br />
<br />
Reviews:<br />
"It’s great to see a director try to recapture the magic of a Spaghetti Western.<br />
<br />
And with the animated opening, the closeups and the sudden bursts of violence, Errol Sack is at least partly successful here.<br />
<br />
Rich Ting makes for a fine, cigar-chomping Dynamite, always on the lookout for roasted peanuts. And Natalie Burn delivers a nice mix of crazy and spunk as the female lead.<br />
<br />
But Chris Northrup sure could have used some Clint Eastwood charisma, not to mention a bit more grit, in the No Name role.<br />
<br />
One scene you won’t want to miss comes when No Name, Dynamite and Pearl encounter a circus troupe. The surprises just keep on coming."<br />
