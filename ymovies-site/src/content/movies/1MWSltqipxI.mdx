Synopsis:<br />
In 1889 the Cherokee Strip is opened to homesteaders, and Don Carver, one of the self-styled "tumbleweeds" and range boss of the Box K Ranch, finds himself out of a job. He meets and falls in love with Molly Lassiter, who belongs to one of the many families of homesteaders who have gathered in Caldwell, Kansas, for the big land rush. Don decides to sign up for a piece of land and hopes to claim the site of the Box K ranch house, which controls the water for the strip. Molly's evil half-brother, Noll, and Bill Freel, Don's rival for Molly's hand, conspire to have Don arrested as a "sooner" when he tries to round up some stray cattle in the Strip. Don breaks out of the stockade to join the rush, but he finds Noll and Freel already at the ranch house when he arrives. Don evicts them, and troopers arrive and arrest the two as "sooners." Molly finally consents to be Don's wife.<br />

Reviews:<br />
"Once it was among the most popular movies of its kind, and now it's generally remembered only by silent movie fans, but "Tumbleweeds" is a classic silent Western that's still worth seeing. To be sure, a lot of its appeal now comes from nostalgia, but in its time it was close to the top of its genre.<br />
<br />
The opening scenes start the story nicely, and they also give it some thoughtful overtones, with cowboys Hart and Lucien Littlefield coming to realize their role as "Tumbleweeds" in a changing world. The 'tumbleweed' image is used well in developing Hart's character, as he faces the consequences of the land rush and of the personal affairs he gets involved in. The story itself has a lot of familiar elements, without many surprises, but the atmosphere and the characters are enough to carry it.<br />
<br />
The land rush sequence is probably the most exciting part of the movie, and it is quite a fine set piece. It's later followed by a fast-paced climactic chase that also works well. The action makes a good complement to the atmosphere of the changing frontier, making it a movie that fits together nicely, and that still works pretty well."<br />
