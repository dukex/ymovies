Reviews:
"Anyone expecting another grim, operatic Italian revenge oater can skip Dynamite Joe. Rik van Nutter is an Eastwood lookalike from a few angles and Antonio Margheriti plays that up in the first few minutes before Joe goes back to a Robert Conrad/Wild Wild West style hero who's a specialist with explosives. van Nutter does an all around good job as a womanizing, easygoing troubleshooter. Hired to transport a gold shipment, Joe sets off huge explosions, romances two pretty girls, tangles with Mexican bandits and crooked American politicians. The cinematography is good, the music by Savina fits the tone of this wacky film and the action is fine, especially a stage coach Chase. There have been comedy westerns alla Italianni before such as Any Gun Can Play and straight westerns with some humor in spots but Dynamite Joe is total silly tongue in cheek slapstick which probably accounts for the heavy criticism." Written by jameselliot-1 on IMDb.com 

"Too much gold disappears during transports, so that the bank director hires an expert to guard the next one: Dynamite Joe (Rik Van Nutter)! Bandits and corrupt business-men are already making plans how to get rid of him, but Joe is prepared for many enemies with plenty of explosives.

The first western movie by Antonio Margheriti is somewhat too pedestrian. In the first half of the movie, nothing much is happening except discussions with bank directors and watching the saloon dancers. Only in the middle of the movie, when the villain seriously starts to attack Dynamite Joe (who replies with, guess what, a very big explosion), the audience wakes up and gets the opportunity to watch a movie that is somewhat entertaining at least in the second half, when the gold transport is on the way. Rik Van Nutter (best known for playing Felix Leiter in the James Bond movie 'Thunderball') is a kind of hero that rather is at home in secret agent movies and appears to be miscast here."
