Reviews:
"A young pistolero called Jesss Brayn (Peter Lee Lawrence) returns to his little town , he formerly left when killed a man . Jess is appointed Sheriff by a powerful man in the city named Bill Bragg (Armando Calvo) . There takes place a murder and there is a clue : ¨Winchester , one of one thousand¨ whose owner turns out to be Jack Bradshaw (Nello Pazzafini) , foreman of Samuel Ringold (Eduardo Fajardo) . Jess decides to find out the identity of a mysterious murderous . Meanwhile , Jess meets his old girlfriends , Sheila (Marisa Solinas) , daughter's sheriff (Luis Induni) and Fanny Endes (Rosalba Neri) . Then occurs a string of killings , and the same clue , a Winchester .

It is an exciting western that packs a story full of violence , fights , killings and subsequent suspense , good dramatic pace , plot twists and slick direction . It contains an intriguing premise to investigate and to discover a killer , including red herrings , and results to be moderately entertaining , though drags at times , balancing in ups and downs . Agreeable Chorizo-Spaghetti Western mostly produced by Spain and important Italian participation , being rightly shot by the Italian professional Primo Zeglio ; it follows the Sergio Leone wake , including close-up , zooms , choreographic duels and no being proceeded in American style . Acceptable action sequences with rousing crossfire and spectacularly bloody shootouts . Charismatic performance for whole casting . The notorious Spaghetti actor , Peter Lee Lawrence is good in his usual tough role . Blond German youth Peter Lee Lawrence, who made his uncredited debut in Sergio Leone "For A Few Dollars More" (1965), was the hero in many Spaghetti Westerns. His short cinematographic history can be enclosed in nine years of Italo-Spain co-productions such as "More Dollars for the MacGregors" , ¨Winchester justice¨,"Pistol for a Hundred Coffins", ¨The man who killed Billy the Kid¨ , ¨Fury of Johnny Kid¨ and several others . Enjoyable though brief performance by the always great Eduardo Fajardo , previously famous for ¨Django¨ , playing a nasty role , as usual . In the film appears ordinary Chorizo/Spaghetti Western actors such as Luis Barboo , Luis Induni , Miguel Del Castillo , Victor Israel , Jose Jaspe , Nello Pazzafini , among others . Colorful and evocative cinematography by Julio Ortas , filmed on location in Hoyo Manzanares del Real , Colmenar Viejo and La Pedriza , Madrid . Atmospheric and evocative musical score by Claudio Tallino , including catching leitmotif.

Eduardo Manzanos built a Western little town in Hoyo De Manzanares (Madrid) called ¨Golden City¨ with sets by Jaime Perez Cubero and Jose Luis Galicia , today sadly disappeared just like is well shown in ¨Winchester, Uno Entre Mil (1968) or Killer, Adios¨." Written by ma-cortes on IMDb.com
