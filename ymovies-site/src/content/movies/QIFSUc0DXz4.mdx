Storyline:
An old man observes a boy bullying his playmates and treats him to a morality lesson. The man tells the story of the epic cross-country race between a young Mark Twain and his rival, Mike Fink. The bulk of the film depicts the race, which proves to be more a test of character than of stamina.

Reviews:
"I first saw this movie aged four, then again aged seven. It captured my imagination with its understated humour and quirky characters, while the adventure-laden plot remains sparklingly original. Until a few months ago I didn't even realise this was a TV movie due to the lovingly crafted scenes and entertaining dialogue. The characters of Mark Twain and Mike Fink have stuck with me ever since, particularly the final scene where the boy is given Twain's eagle feather as a momento of the tale. Incredible Rocky Mountain Race is a worthy movie by any standard" -written by "Tuco Ramirez" on IMDb.com
