Reviews:
"This movie includes most every cliche from every prior western movie. And yet it also includes a bit extra that makes it worth a look. The main advantage is the impish charm of Marty Robbins    his performance is good enough to make me wonder why he didn't have more of a movie career. I think he could have gone much farther."

"The main appeal is the way you never know who's side to be on. The ending is shocking and will leave an impression on you."
