Outlaw Sam Black is after the girl and her father as well. Besides dealing with the Black gang, Morrell has to find another robber, Jim Moore, who switches clothes with him after he finds Chris unconscious from a fight with Sam Black.

Reviews:
"John Wayne, as Daddy Chris radiates his natural warmth in protecting a half-Indian girl and trying to find her father. Sam Black (Yakima Canutt) and his gang are hot on his trail with armed robbers, Buffalo Bill Jr. and Jack Rockwell who attempt to frame Wayne. Sheila Terry looked stunning dressed to the nines but somewhat out of place amidst the dust and gunfights. Shirley Jean Rickert, from "Our Gang" fame, gives a sweet and memorable performance as Daddy Chris assures her, "Don't worry, little partner, I wouldn't give you up for anything!" Some memorable moments when Duke does a lasso/elevator trick and pulls a henchmen off his horse and strings him up a tree and him and Canutt go cliff diving into the river for some classic fisticuffs. As always 'Gabby' Hayes and Earl Dwire give great performances to round out a great cast 'Neath The Arizona Skies."
