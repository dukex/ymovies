Storyline:<br />
Charles Southwood is Alan Burton, who hitches a ride on a stage to San Antonio that quickly comes under attack.<br />
<br />
A former Confederate major riding on the stage is mortally wounded, and reveals the reason: He’s carrying one of three two-headed gold pieces that reveal the location of $2 million in stashed Rebel payroll.<br />
<br />
Burton sets out for Sonora, where the second gold piece is supposed to be in the hands of an ex-Confederate sergeant.<br />
<br />
But he’s going to have competition in his quest. A bandit leader known as El Condor (Mirko Ellis) was behind the stage attack and has a small army of henchmen to do his bidding.<br />
<br />
He’s heard the tale of the hidden treasure too. And he’s already killed the sergeant in order to get his hands on one of the coins, which include code messages about the location of the fortune.<br />
<br />
Burton finds allies in a Hondo, a young Mexican who helps him break out of jail at a key moment; and Juana, a saloon girl who yearns for the day she’ll find a man and return to the farm she used to live on in Tennessee. Written by Mark Franklin on http://onceuponatimeinawestern.com<br />

Reviews:<br />
"Fun Western about two drifters who team up to steal three golden coins ; both of whom carry out several adventures , saloon brawls , shootouts and resolve conflicts among nasty robbers that want to take a treasure . Entertaining Spaghetti Western dealing with a greedy mouse-and cat game to take valuable coins in which there are inscriptions to locate the hidden treasure . As a few people are on the search of three one Dollar coins with numbers that show where a Confederate treasure is buried . Alan Burton (Charles Southwood) accused for a crime is jailed in prison , there meets a cellmate , the Mexican Hondo (Julian Mateos). The bandits break out and join forces themselves to discover it and they are frequently fist fighting , and disputing against the nasty El Condor (Mirko Ellis) to keep the treasure for themselves . There are three coins , one of them owns the villain El Condor , another stays guarded at a bank safe box and the third was taken by Burton to a Southern Major in Stagecoach (Guillermo Méndez) . Burton and Hondo become good colleagues , but they cannot get along peacefully . Meantime , a beautiful Posada girl called Juana helps both drifters and plays both sides against each other . El Condor and his henchmen attempt to rob a bank , but he and his cohorts foil the planned robbery . Along the way our two not so upright heroes rob the robbers but, needless to say, Burton get distracted by the gorgeous Saloon girl .<br />
<br />
Passable Spaghetti Western about a simple and plain plot , as two outlaws compete with each other over a treasure . As duo protagonist take on a sadistic crime boss , and his black-dressed hoodlums , who attempt to find the Army treasure . This movie is a bawdy , plenty of action Western , not the dark and vengeful kind one might expect from a typical Spaghetti , being more a story of ambition than vengeance ."
