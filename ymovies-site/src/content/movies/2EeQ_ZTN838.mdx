In rural Mexico, Salvador Pérez Gómez's parents die mysteriously, so the boy grows up under the care of Chaflán, his parents' farmhand, and his godfather Radilla, a Spanish bartender who instills in him a desire for revenge.

Reviews:
"This film from the Golden Age of Mexican cinema marked the beginning of worldwide fame for one of its greatest stars: the now legendary Jorge Negrete, aka the "Charro cantor", the nostalgic archetype of the charro in times after the Mexican Revolution. ¡Ay Jalisco, no te rajes!' is a dramatic comedy typical of its time, with great musical themes composed by Manuel Esperón and Ernesto Cortázar (the most renowned composers of the Golden Age), and the presence of other luminaries such as Gloria Marín and the then little Evita Muñoz, who went down in the history of Mexican cinema as the beloved "Chachita"."
