Review:<br />
It's actually quite good<br />
"Comin' at Ya!" is weird, mean, strange, serious and very silly. It's also a pretty good movie. It took me many moons to appreciate spaghetti westerns. I've since become a huge fan of Sergio Leone's films. I've recently been watching a lot of the non-Leone movies. Those spaghetti westerns are hit and miss. And despite all of the 3d stuff, "Comin' at Ya!" lands on the plus side of the ledger. Director Ferdinando Baldi had an interesting approach. I didn't really understand it but his use of color vs B&W was kind of cool. This movie is also greatly helped by the wildly dreamy Victoria Abril. Many of them other women were also quite dreamy, especially the one that played Diana. All in all, I would watch "Comin' at Ya!" again. Man, I wish I saw this in 3d. I was in high school when this came out and I could have. Oh well, spilt milk.<br />
