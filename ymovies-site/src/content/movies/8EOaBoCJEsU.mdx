Reviews: <br />
"Peckinpah's first feature film is an understated, yet solid, Western. The film stars Brian Keith (who had worked with Peckinpah on The Westerner television series) as "Yellowleg", a gunman who escorts a dancehall girl (O'Hara) across the desert in order to bury her recently deceased son alongside the boy's father. Their journey is complicated by unfriendly Indians as well as Yellowleg's treacherous partners (played by Chill Wills and Steve Cochran). This movie has an excellent cast, beautiful scenery and a good story. Although Sam Peckinpah declared himself dissatisfied, "L'office des communications sociales du Canada" gave this movie a (3) rate, which means "very good". That's perfectly just. Unfortunately, it's not disponible on video. But sometimes it's diffused on TV. Just last night, the CFCF channel showed this film and so I taped it. So if ever you see this movie, don't miss it." Written by Mort-13 on IMDb.com<br />
<br />
"It's time this movie took its rightful place in Peckinpah's career. Some discussions of the director don't even mention it, and I suspect that's partly because of its relative unavailability. At least it needs to be seen before making generalizations about his treatment of women, as O'Hara's character is his only strong dramatic female character (echoed later by Stella Stevens' good-time gal in the whimsical Ballad of Cable Hogue). It also shows his gentle, lyrical side in a serious context, which is an important counterweight to the brutality he's famous for. And it might provide a point of entry for those who otherwise find his work off-putting." Written by princehal on IMDb.com<br />
