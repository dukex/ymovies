A British soldier decides to move to the American frontier and start a new life. He finds the frontier tough and struggles with the climate, thieves and swindlers. He is accused of murder and put on trial.<br />
<br />
Based on a true story, Showdown at Williams Creek is about a British soldier named John Brown (Tom Burlinson), who moves to America's Wild West, settling in the Montana territory with the hopes of making a fortune. However, things don't go entirely as planned in America, as he has to survive not only nature, but a vast array of thieves, cheats, and schemers. The culmination of his misadventures is when Brown is put on trial for killing an old man. Boasting several terrific performances, Showdown At Williams Creek is one of the darkest examinations of the Old West and the gold rush to be told on film. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi<br />
