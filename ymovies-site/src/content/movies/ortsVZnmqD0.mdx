Synopsis:<br />
When lawyer Mitch Baker's (Scott Brady) father is killed by gun-runners, he pursues the villains who escape into Mexico. Gang leader Jim Simmons, beyond the reach of the American law, is confident that his henchmen can get rid of Mitch but he's mistaken... Mitch plays the waiting game in the border town of Mission, Texas, where he attracts the interest of Angelita (Anne Bancroft), a young Indian woman. The sheriff warns Mitch not to take the law into his own hands, but he's determined to avenge his father's death his way.<br />
<br />
Reviews:<br />
For his last western, veteran director Dwan transforms Fisher's crude revenge plot into a gentle comedy. Brady is the son of a government agent out to revenge his father's death, Davis the outlaw leader who inhabits a Mexican-American border town and Bancroft the girl who gets her man. Made on a minuscule budget, the film has an austerity and formality about it that few films achieve. As a delightful touch (and a throwback to the days of silent cinema)Dwan has the characters appear to be perpetually eavesdropping on each other. A marvellous film.<br />
