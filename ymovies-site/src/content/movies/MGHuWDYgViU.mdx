Review:
Sizable role for the legendary Spaghetti Western character actor Fernando Sancho. More of a sympathetic character than his typical bandito role.
Good music, but the voice selection for the English dub could have been better, especially for Rosalba Neri, who looks exceptionally beautiful here for a female in a western.
One of the best westerns Rosie got cast in, although it was a lousy role for her, just a woman reacting to the actions of the men, kind of a waste of her abilities. Nice performances by George Martin and Daniel Martín.
Worth a watch for fans of Fernando Sancho and Rosalba Neri completionists. Written by Jreg32 on letterboxd.com
