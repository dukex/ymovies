Storyline:<br />
A Korean war veteran attempts to help a small town mine owner develop his tungsten mine in spite of efforts by the town boss to stop him.<br />
<br />
Reviews:<br />
"As befits an adaptation of a Luke Short novel, the basic situation of a small Denver town in the pocket of a megalomaniac with deep pockets has seen service in countless 'B' westerns. But it's brought up to date by substituting tungsten for silver in the local mine, by occasionally noirish photography by Republic veteran Jack Marta, that the hero is a veteran of the Korean War and that he goes about by jeep rather than on horseback.<br />
<br />
Curiously enough it uses the plot of 'Cyrano de Bergerac' as a springboard for the action; and a number of veteran supporting actors put in brief appearances, including Arthur Q. Bryan (the voice of Elmer Fudd) on the phone to obnoxious villain John Russell." Written by richardchatten on IMDb.com <br />
<br />
"Rod Cameron is the strapping hero of this action western story which tells of a remote mining town presided over by John Russell's boorish boss. Cameron butts heads with his foe from the outset, and what follows is a surprisingly tight little story of rivalry and excitement, centring around a mining operation. Russell's villain is one of the slimiest of the year, and the action is regularly punctuated by sprawling fist fights between our hero and villain which are adroitly staged. Not a film you'd ever describe as a classic, but it does the job." Written by Leofwine_draca on IMDb.com <br />
