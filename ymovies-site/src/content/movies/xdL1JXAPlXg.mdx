During the 1895 Mexican uprising against Mexican President Diaz, former American outlaws Cross and Boone venture south of the border to recover a haul of gold from an old heist. In addition, Cross receives a discreet assignment from the revolutionaries who want Cross to sabotage the Mexican government train he is traveling on with Boone. They use dynamite to blow up the tracks, but are captured by the Mexican army. To avoid execution by firing squad, Cross and Boone accept Mexican General Garcia's offer to work for him. Their mission, against all odds as specified by the general, is to take a train full of dynamite from Chihuahua to an army outpost in Durango. Their journey will take them through rebel territory, Indian territory and wastelands traversed by Mexican bandits. Without much choice, Cross and Boone accept the deal. Little do they know that a posse of Wells Fargo deputies is after them and bent on recovering the stolen gold. Written by nufs68 on IMDb.com<br />

Reviews:<br />
I love this movie. It may not be Willie Nelson, Jack Elam, Delta Burke's best - I think it's a fun western adventure that I enjoy watching. This movie is on my list of favorites along with the Gunsmoke made-for-TV movies, Once Upon A Texas Train, etc. For some of these great actors, like Jack Elam and Richard Widmark, to name a few, these made-for-TV westerns were the last of their film careers. I wish the TV networks would make more of these movies, because the western frontier is such an important part of American history. I just bought the movie on DVD, which has been hard to find. i give this movie 10 stars and 2 thumbs up!!!!! Written by waynermasters on IMDb.com<br />

Seeing the previous reviews of this movie, I assumed I would be disappointed. I was pleasantly surprised. There is a good mix of action and comedy throughout the movie, Elam and Nelson make a good team, and Delta Burke looks and acts as good as I've ever seen her. Willie's performance is a bit wooden, but I find that's usually the case. For a made-for-TV movie, it's very well done. Written by smitty008 on IMDb.com<br />
