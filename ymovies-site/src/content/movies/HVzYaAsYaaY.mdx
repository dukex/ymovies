Storyline: 
Charming, blithely amoral devil-may-care rogue Jesse Smith and peaceful, devout straight-arrow Mormon Lester O'Hara are estranged half brothers who are reunited after receiving a sizable inheritance from their deceased mother. The wildly contrasting mismatched duo get into all sorts of trouble while trying to claim said inheritance.

Reviews: 
"This easy-to-like Italian western comedy was one of the many early 70s knock-offs of the financially successful "Trinity" films starring Terence Hill and Bud Spencer. Although I've always liked the Hill/Spencer vehicles, JESSE AND LESTER is to me a much better film. First of all, Richard Harrison possesses a charisma and sexual appeal that Hill has never had--he's also an actor with a lot of depth and plays the charming rogue character very well. And Donald O'Brien is quite convincing as the devout Mormon. Also, the film is beautifully shot and a pleasure to watch throughout. And that comes through even on the cheap Venezuelan video I own. While the film may run a bit too long (comedies, for me, tend to work better when approx. 80 minutes), it is a little- known gem that should appeal to any fan of the Trinity series... or anyone who likes a good western comedy."
