Reviews:<br />
"This is a semi-¨Zapata¨ Western plenty of Gunplay and revenge along with a fraternal story . Spaghetti and Chorizo Western , co-produced between Spain and Italy and starred by two ordinary Spaghetti actors as the Italian Guglielmo Spoletini as William Bogart and the Spanish Eduardo Fajardo dealing with a real and violent confrontation . This is not an ordinary oater outing , it's a Spaghetti with Paella Western crammed with action , shootouts , lots of violence and a thought-provoking as well as sensitive story . The film follows the American Western models but also in Spaghetti style . An Italian-Spanish co-production with outdoor sequences filmed in Colmenar Viejo , La Pedriza and Manzanares Del Real , Madrid , and , Almeria , of course . Concerning Martin Rojas (Guglielmo Spoletini as William Bogart) is a poor Mexican peasant whose home is destroyed by nasty American homesteaders ; after that , he and his unhappy partners (Fernando Sánchez Pollack) are forced to abandon their lands and flee to Mexico after they kill some cutthroats . Rojas and his bunch of Mexican people become bandits and helped by Trevor organize a big bank holdup run by a banker (Miguel Del Castillo) .

<br />
It's full of action , exaggerated characters , shootouts , loads of violence , but also displays an exciting and nicely developed screenplay , full of thrilling as well as interesting and sentimental events . It's a medium budget film with usual actors , good technicians, passable production values and acceptable results . A better than average Western regarding a revenge story , with plenty of violence ,shoot'em up , thrills and noisy action. "Death Knows No Time" or "Tierra Brava" or ¨Pagó Cara su Muerte¨ is an exciting western with breathtaking showdown between the protagonist , an unlucky countryman become a gunslinger who is forced to make a fundamental choice about his life , against his relentless enemies ."
