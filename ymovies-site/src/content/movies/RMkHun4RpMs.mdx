He finds the Rev. Smith (Alfio Caltabiano as Alf Thunder) in a small town. Seems Smith came across a dying priest during his getaway and decided to take the man’s place. He’s even spent part of the stolen money to build a church.<br />
<br />
Well, Horatio demands part of the stolen money. And he’s prepared to sell the church to new owners who want to turn it into a saloon.<br />
<br />
Then he’s thrown in jail for stealing Smith’s horse. And winds up in jail cell next to The Professor (Dante Maggio), who knows all about the town’s impenetrable bank, the one that holds $500,000.<br />

But it’s going to take a master safe cracker to pull the job. So Horatio mends fences with the reverend and they hatch a scheme to pull off the job with the help of Grampa, his young nephew and a barman/painter with a desire for a more exciting life.<br />
