Storyline:
Everyone wants to know who the Mexican is. He always answer slowly, "my name is Pecos". Pecos Martinez ( Robert Woods) to be exact, and he's returned to his hometown of Houston to settle up with Clain(Norman Clarke), the leader of a gang of cut-throats. Clain is busy looking for the money from a recent robbery that's been stolen from him. Soon the stolen cash in Pecos' vengeance entwine and all hell breaks loose. Behind the scenes a Bible touting Undertaker (Umberto Raho), a cowardly saloon owner, & a helpful saloon girl (Christina Iosani) become part of the story. This film made Woods as internationally known as Pecos in the third world countries as Franco Nero was known for Django. A Mexican hero against a gang and a town full of gringos- what more could you ask for?

Reviews:
"In Fargo we saw an extremely laid-back crook in the car-salesman. The bureaucrat-crook one might say. In this film he has his western counter-part. Never seen this actor in anything else, which is quite unique by its own. Pecos himself is some sort of mexican. They changed his eyes for the role, similarly as they did to Sean Connery for 'You Only Live Twice'. The follow-up to this was quite good as well, but this one is special. Many unique gags and a hero who jumps up on his horse from the back. Those who hear him say 'My Name is Pecos' in the beginning of the film are already dead, when trying to shoot him in the back. Some gags were stolen from this film for 'Trinity', who was a much less interesting hero. A 10 out of 10." Written by karlericsson on IMDb.com.

Warning: Spoilers
"Great little flick that unveils a revenge of a slaughtered family and justice being served by a family member. My name is Pecos to me was a gritty film that had a great variety of musical scores in it by Lallo Gori. The camera work was done well by both Giuseppe Ruzzolini and Armando Nannuzzi. Great acting by Robert Woods (Pecos Martinez) and the creepy Morton character who can read the future and make predictions through a deck of poker cards lol.. The opening scene started off great of Pecos walking to Houston no gun carrying a saddle and slowly dying of thirst making us wonder how this could be. He comes up to a sinister looking man in all black who gives him water and a gun only to be killed and after hes been killed the drifter reveals his name Pecos. The two problems, I had with the movie was one the girl who played Nina amazing body but a butterface terrible shame. The second was a weak rushed back story of Joe Kline the lead bad guy killed Pecos Martinez's family as he stated three years ago but when, he looked at him it didn't dawn who the "Mexican" was until he finds out late in the movie who he is then it hits him duh. Three years is not a long time ago! Other then this the movie was fun and great music worth watching and enjoying!" Written by tcaramela on IMDb.com.
