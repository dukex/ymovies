Reviews:
"One of the few (only?) westerns where sex is the main motivator, a wonderful spaghetti western with Fabio Testi and Jenny Agutter, with Warren Oates and a rare performance by Sam Peckingpaugh. An important film in the ouvre of Monte Hellman, quintessential 70's cult director; a man who has made more great films than Coppola yet remains mostly unknown in his home country. See "Two-Lane Blacktop," "Cockfighter," and "The Shooting."" Written by dbuskirk1 on IMDb.com.

Warning: Spoilers
"I saw this at the 1978 Telluride Film Festival with Monte Hellman in attendance. We were a bit worse for chemicals at that time, but the film made an indelible impression on my pals and me. To this day we still talk about it and quote some of the most outrageous lines put into a film up until that time.

Since then I've been trying to find the version I saw, but have only encountered pablum-style crap with all the good stuff edited out and horrific washed-out video transfers.

So I need to ask, are my memories of these lines from the film accurate or did whatever was in me at the time make them up?

Testi to Agutter: "As long as I have a face, you'll have a place to sit."

And, Warren Oates to the world in general: "If they didn't have c*nts there'd be a bounty on them."

A great, OTT film for its time. Where is Monte Hellman when we need him?" Written by bfdeal-1 on IMDb.com.

""China 9, Liberty 37" sounds like the final score of a high school girls' basketball game, but it is the American title of this spaghetti western. Fabio Testi plays the part of Clayton Drumm, a gunslinger who avoids the hangman's noose by agreeing to take on a job--the murder of a man, Matthew Sebanek (Warren Oates), whose land is desired by the railroad. He rides to the man's property and insinuates himself into the household. Like Clint Eastwood, he is the quiet, deadly type and the lady of the house, Catherine (Jenny Agutter) takes a hankering to him.

A large part of the story is a romance. But most of the characters are driven by pride or greed, so you know love will probably suffer in the crossfire.

Better known for such films as "Walkabout" and "Logan's Run", Jenny Agutter does a credible job as the object of men's desires. Nudity is a sizable part of her role. Testi, as the strong silent type is enough to stir a frontier woman's imagination. Oates, as usual, plays a scruffy, steely-eyed guy." Written by atlasmb on IMDb.com.
