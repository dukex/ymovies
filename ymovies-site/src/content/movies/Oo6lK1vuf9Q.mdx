Synopsis:
John Abbott returns to the desert land he owns, and after being wounded by hired gunman Chick Chance, he is befriended by rancher Andrew Naab and his son, Marvin.

She runs away on her wedding day but is captured and held hostage by outlaw Henry Holderness. John, the Naabs and fellow ranchers rush to her rescue.

Reviews:
"A typically entertaining entry in Paramount's Zane Grey series, well directed by Lesley Selander, this doesn't have the star power of earlier films, but the story's solid and the script well-written. Production values are pretty good too.

A personable cast is headed by the likable Woods, with excellent support by Robert Barrat as the noble family patriarch, Evelyn Venable (the original model for the Columbia Pictures logo) as his daughter, and Willard Robertson in a limited but fascinating role as a hired gun that despite his being employed by the bad guys, insists on keeping his own code of honor intact.

One of the film's triumphs is that you actually care about these characters. The rousing climax is quite satisfying too.

Recommended."
