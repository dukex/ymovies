Her uncle started the saloon, but was killed the day she arrived in town by town boss Tucan (Luis Induni) and his henchmen. The saloon sits on what Tucan believes is an underground treasure of silver. So he wants her saloon and the land on which it’s located. Reopening the saloon stirs up a new round of hostilities that includes an attack on the Donovan ranch and that convinces Djurado everyone might be better off if he left town. But Tucan still has a grudge against the young men. Djurado is tracked down and beaten. And while he recovers from his wounds, Tucan has his men rob a bank and leave behind a clue that points to Djurado as the guilty party. Now he has no choice but to return to Silver Mine to try to clear his name and end Tucan’s reign of tyranny.
