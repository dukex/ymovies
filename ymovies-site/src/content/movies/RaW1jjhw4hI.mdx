Storyline:
A western set in Texas in the years after the Civil War. Quell is the leader of a group of honest homesteaders who attempt to right the wrongs that come their way. But when a nasty land mogul by the name of Kirk begins to get out of line by treating the innocent people of the frontier cruelly, he becomes the group's primary target. Whether it's with harsh words or flying fists, Quell and company are the West's most formidable levelers of justice. And nobody, not even the vicious, tyrannical land baron, can stop them from making things right. Written by Echo Bridge Home Entertainment on IMDb.com 

Reviews:
Until recently, "Showdown at Eagle Gap" (aka Quell and Co.) did not show up in any William Witney filmography, not even the one in his own autobiography. My thanks to Francis M. Nevins for his insights into this film, a German-US co-production which received minimal release. In fact, I completely failed to recognise that Witney, the man himself, has a touching cameo at the very end of the film. He (pseudonymously) plays a sheriff who checks in on Quell and his two friends and he wishes them good luck when he salutes them as if giving them a blessing. Mr Nevins pointed out to me as well that it was fitting that Witney's first and last films centred on western trios, a mainstay of classic B grade westerns. His first feature film as a director was the excellent action-packed Three Mesquiteers entry, "The Trigger Trio". I have previously written that this was "an unusually bland film for Witney, but a lesser Witney film is still pretty good. It is an engrossing yarn rather typical of 1970s American television." I stand by those comments, but Mr Nevins' insights have me enjoying "Showdown at Eagle Gap" in different ways. If you like Witney's pictures or westerns in general, it is worth checking out.
