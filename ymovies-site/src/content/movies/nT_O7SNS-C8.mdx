Storyline:
Cowboy Ross McEwen arrives in town. He asks the banker for a loan of $2000. When the banker asks about securing a loan that large, McEwen shows him his six-gun collateral. The banker hands over the money in exchange for an I.O.U., signed "Jefferson Davis". McEwen rides out of town and catches a train, but not before being bitten by a rattler. On the train, a nurse, Miss Hollister, tends to his wound. A posse searches the train, but McEwen manages to escape notice. However a mysterious Mexican has taken note of the cowboy, and that loudmouthed brat is still nosing around. Who will be the first to claim the reward for the robber's capture?

Reviews:
"First rate story, production, and cast. Not a shot is fired is this wonderfully low-key story." Written by Wrangler on IMDb.com

"Joel McCrea and Francis Dee are exceptional people. They made this one of the best family westerns of all time. To bad there are not anymore actors or actresses like this anymore. We have hit a low in good clean acting, and good movie plots." Written by lazygmranch on IMDb.com

"Harold Rosson must have been an interesting character. He was briefly married to Jean Harlow, for one thing. He was a top cinematographer for many years for MGM (check him out in IMDb). On this very moderately budgeted film, his pictures are just beautiful all through. Contrary to one reviewer, I found his depictions of Frances Dee most expressive and elegant too. Was this a sort of busman's holiday for Rosson, getting out of the studio quite a bit? Was he helping out a friend, or what took him to this assignment?" Written by filmart-2 on IMDb.com
