Reviews:
"This is a classic comedy western. Judy owns the town's general store. Central to the plot is her deceased grandmother, Oklahoma Annie, who was the best female Sheriff Oklahoma ever had. The story starts hopping when outlaws rob the town's bank by blowing up the safe. The crooks are identified and this leads to the Sheriff quitting because, as he puts it, "I don't what to be the bravest man in the cemetery".

In steps the new, handsome Sheriff, played by John Russell. Prompting our Judy to become a little more interested in crime fighting. The truth of it is, Judy is also full of spunk and wants to follow in grandmother's footsteps. Early on the viewer realizes that someone within the town helped the outlaws rob the bank. Frank Ferguson plays the town's supervisor and he has a knack of getting in the way of the investigation.

Meanwhile, Judy has become the Sheriff's deputy because she helped capture one of the outlaws (Roy Barcroft). Still, one question remains, who is the brains behind the robbery? Can you doubt that Judy will find out everything?

One reviewer of this film states they would be embarrassed if one of their relatives liked Oklahoma Annie. This film was a aimed at the Saturday Matinée kids back in the day. A few of us have never lost our inner kid, thankfully. So please don't be embarrassed for me and in return I won't roll my eyes when the politically correct come along and tell us the movies of long ago are embarrassing."
