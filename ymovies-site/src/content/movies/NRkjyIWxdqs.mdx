Storyline:<br />
Actor Ben Castle is a phony singing cowboy who can not ride, sing, or act, and is afraid of guns and horses and the first one out the door when trouble breaks out. His studio hires attorney Abigail Furnival, to get him out of trouble with a big-time gambler because he can not pay off a gambling debt. And the next thing she knows is that she has married him. The gambler decides to write off the debt when he learns that Abigail is the daughter of an old friend. But the gambler is murdered, and Ben appears to be involved.<br />
<br />
Reviews:<br />
"Ben Castle is a Hollywood sensation as a singing cowboy, with his horse Pancho. But Ben can't sing, draw a gun or ride a horse. Heck - he even needs a step-ladder to get on Pancho! Ben seems to have bad luck gambling too, as he owes a $60,000 debt to Las Vegas gambler Harry Kallen. Hoping to find a way to settle the debt, he hires a lawyer - 'A.J.' Furnival, played by Ginger Rogers.<br />
<br />
Ben and A.J. fly to Vegas to try to settle the matter. In just a few hours, Ben and A.J. get married. As a wedding present, Harry says the debt is forgiven. After that, we're treated with the ups and down of life married to a big-time celebrity. Things take a drastic change when an unexpected event changes everything.<br />
<br />
A little comic relief is provided by Ben's house-boy, Ignacio, played by Victor Sen Yung. What we get from Ignacio is your stereotypical Chinese man for the time. By today's standards, some people might find this - and one scene in particular - very offensive. But back in the early 50's, it was considered funny.<br />
<br />
The Groom Wore Spurs is a decent light, breezy sort of romantic comedy that Hollywood used to crank out all the time. What makes it special - for me at least - is the joy of being able to watch Ginger Rogers!Fans of her will really enjoy this movie and they made sure to have a scene where we get to look at Ginger's legs in high heels. Now isn't that reason enough to watch the movie? For me it is!" Written by archi_cianfrocco on IMDb.com <br />
