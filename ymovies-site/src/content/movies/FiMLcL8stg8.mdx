<br />
Reviews:<br />
"Whilst it is difficult to ascertain which is the greatest Spencer / Hill film - it could arguably be this - by some distance this is the greatest cinematic performance to date from the legendary Joe Bugner.<br />
<br />
Whilst still a heavyweight boxer, and lest we forget a contender for the world title, Bugner somehow managed to find the time to perform in films such as this. Does he make the the transition with success? Oh yes, certainly. It turns out that Bugner is an exceptional actor; what a shame his talents have not been used in too many other films.<br />
<br />
Fans of Spencer and Hill will no doubt have seen this film already, but for anyone out there looking for more Joe Bugner than they have already seen then this is the film for you."<br />
