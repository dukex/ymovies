Review:<br />
<br />
While stationed in Thailand in 1972 during the Vietnam War, I had an opportunity to get a part-time job operating a movie projector at the base theater for the midnight show. One of the films I was fortunate to show was "Somthing Big", a rowdy, unpretentious western with a fun and talented cast headed by Dean Martin, Brian Keith, Albert Salmi and Honor Blackman. The film's strongest point is that it didn't take itself too seriously, yet still presented a fine array of subplots and character studies that nicely wove themselves together to a rousing finale. What has stuck out most in my mind for over the past 30+ years, however, was the movie's theme song. Like the film itself, the title song was a joyous and melodic tribute to the desire in everyone to reach for that star in the heavens, or that impossible dream. It is disappointing that the film never made it to VHS or DVD. If it ever shows up on cable TV, don't miss an opportunity to see this lost guilty pleasure. Written by Thinman2001. <br />
