Reviews:
"I highly recommend this movie. It is a visual treat and an homage to art film with long framed shots against spectacular backdrops. I believe it was filmed in Oklahoma. This isn't your regular nomadic cowboy feature. You can expect shootout, cowboys, epic music, and majestic horses. However the heart of the story will have you holding back tears. Graham Phillips delivered an important performance in his rising career which will without a doubt get him noticed as a leading man.

The plot is gritty yet portrayed with true heart. Characters are well written allowing ebb and flow in their delivery. It didnt feel like any character was secondary to the plot. Even though they don't get a lot of screen time together, The contrast of character delivery between both Phillips's protagonist and Shawn Hatosy's antagonist is felt throughout the movie heightening the tension. Kip's (Phillips) warmth is the perfect balance to Paris's (Hatosy) darkness. The use of light and frame perspective definitely had me running to my camera as it ignited my passions for art cinema.

There is a line in the movie where Kip (Phillips) claims he is a sucker for Westerns. Considering he co-wrote and co-directed the movie, he definitely delivered his passion through the lens." Written by melsabaawi on IMDb.com 

"I really enjoyed this moving- from the gripping plot to the stunning cinematography. I haven't seen any of the Phillips brother's other works, but the lead actor (Graham Phillips) was incredibly relatable and did such a good job at bringing out the human side of Kip. Male protagonists these days are all too often portrayed as perfect manly men, but Phillips did an incredible job of feeling honest and adding raw grit to the character.

This movie could not be more fair." Written by PhiveAlph on IMDb.com
