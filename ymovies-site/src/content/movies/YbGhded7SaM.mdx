<br />
Reviews:<br />
This Fidani Sartana movie is a cheap but also a very funny movie.<br />
<br />
As all the other Fidani movies it's only a real fun for fans.<br />
<br />
It has nothing do to with the other Sartana movies with Gianni Garko as protagonist, here the stuntman Jeff Cameron plays Sartana. You can also see a few other stuntman who have played in the most of Fidanis western like Benito Pacifico, Dino Strano, Luciano Conti his daughter Simonetta and you can also see the master himself with incredible big glasses. The soundtrack from Lallo Gori is also really great.<br />
<br />
The movie is very enjoyable, a must see for Trashfans.<br />
