Storyline:
A cattle baron takes in an orphaned boy and raises him, causing his own son to resent the boy.

Reviews:
"Unfortunately, the rest of the cast was weak...wyatt earp (hugh o'brien) is totally at sea as a tough guy brother and john ireland is barely passable as the enraged brother hell bent on getting his sister's child a last name.... robert walker plays a familiar role as the chiseling son, cheating on his wife and his father and step brother but finally gets his reward in the end ... for an opening western role, lancaster makes it work" Written by sandcrab277 on IMDb.com.

"Burt Lancaster carries this film that has several adult themes. Good supporting cast and fantastic scenery make it a good watch. Like most Westerns made in the 50s the pace is fast and the 83 minutes fly by." Written by csmith-99615 on IMDb.com.

"Watching Burt Lancaster's early efforts (such as "The Rose Tattoo") might make one wonder why he was allowed to continue. Watching his later portrayals, one knows exactly why.

Probably his looks, especially his physique, gave him his chance, but Burt Lancaster just got better and better as an actor.

"Vengeance Valley" is a good example.

He was surrounded by good to very good actors but he didn't have to take second place to any, not even Ray Collins.

Since a very large portion of his film roles was in westerns, probably no one should be surprised at how good a cowboy he was, but it is still a pleasurable surprise to see him horseback, in fights, drawing his pistol.

He portrays the proper emotions, to the right degree.

Besides the excellent Lancaster, every cast member seems perfect. I have to admit I did not recognize Hugh O'Brian behind his whiskers and surly manner -- meaning he was so good, he was submerged in his character.

Big studio westerns were often overdone, with too much plot and too little action. "Vengeance Valley," though, shows what those studios could have done, much more often.

There are several versions available on YouTube so you can watch it. And I hope you do." Written by morrisonhimself on IMDb.com.
