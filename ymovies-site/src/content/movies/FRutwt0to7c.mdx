Reviews:<br />
""Between Men" is a film with lots of outdoor action filmed in the Alabama Hills with the Eastern Sierra as backdrop. Run-away wagons pulled by horses at full tilt, big multi-horse and rider chases, gunfights on horseback, and people in peril on lonely and dusty desert expanses with precipitous mountains in view are just some of the fine outdoor moments that come to mind. JMB evolves convincingly from a slick-haired proper young man in 19th-century rural Virginia to a rough and ready young man ready to take on adventure in the old West. <br />
The story is ripe with pathos and told with a rich array of characters parading through the scenes. Veteran silent-era star William Farnum gives his all with his typical exaggerated expressionistic acting...somehow it is almost always a delight to see him in performance. Plus, Earl Dwire...yes once again Mr. Dwire gives another of his beautifully-done dastardly portrayals. <br />
This is a bare-bones show, budget-wise, but the story and action delightfully carry us along anyway. And although he shares plenty of screen time with his fellow actors, make no mistake-- this is a Johnny Mack Brown show, with plenty of his easy-going, manly demeanor on display. This is a very good B-western!"<br />
