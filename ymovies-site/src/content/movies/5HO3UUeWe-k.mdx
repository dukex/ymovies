Reviews:
"In reviewing another of a member of the original "Dallas" cast's previous movie and/or TV appearances in chronological order, I once again watched another of Jim Davis' Republic movies from 1950. In this one, he reteams with Forrest Tucker from Hellfire and Brimstone and director Joseph Kane from the latter and The Savage Horde. He's been both a good guy and a bad guy and here, well, I'll just leave it to you to find out which he is if you ever get the chance to watch on Netflix Streaming which is where I found this but I'll say that as a partner of Tucker in a gambling joint, he doesn't get much trust from him. Written by James Edward Grant who would frequently also create many John Wayne vehicles, this is a fine western rich in both characterization and action. So on that note, I'll just say I highly recommend California Passage. P.S. When Davis' character meets the leading lady Adele Mara, he initially mistakingly addresses her as a Miss Wentworth before she corrects him by saying her name is Beth Martin. That made me chuckle a little since I knew that on "Dallas", there was a character named Rebecca Wentworth who was Pam and Cliff Barnes' mother." Written by tavm on IMDb.com

"I call Lounge those westerns from Republic pictures which most of the time took place more in lounges and saloons, cabarets and saloons than in the open land. Those westerns starring the likes of Rod Cameron, Forrest Tucker, Vera Ralston, John Russell and many more "acteurs maison". Not bad features, not that intellectual either but nothing to do with John Ford nor John Sturges either. Those westerns where leads wore more costumes than cow boys pants and shirts. I have nothing more to say about this movie made by Joe Kane, another "maison" director from the Serial company. PS Jack Ford actually directed a couple of westerns for Republic an they had nothing to do with this kind. Nothing at all." Written by searchanddestroy-1 on IMDb.com

"This was a step above most low budget "Pulp Westerns" It is surprisingly well written for this type of Western. Joseph Kane's directing shows a genuine command for the western. James Edward Grant successfully weaves a yarn that is a good mix of action and character banter, Forest Tucker stars and is Very believable as the handsome leading Man, Mike Prescott. Jim Davis is wooden as Linc" Corey especially during the scene where he woos Adele Mara's Bess. Davis is a very believable and effective villain. He's much more at ease in the saddle and in the action scenes. Charles Kemper as the humorous Sheriff Willy steals the movie. He was very an effective foil to some of the violence  good comic relief. All in all California Passage was nice ride into the Old West." Written by sicula-1 on IMDb.com
