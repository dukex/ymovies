Story: <br />
Leslie Caron is Sister Mary, the sole survivor of an Apache attack on a wagon train. She’s left to roam the countryside on a mule, trying to find her way to Sante Fe, when she comes across a gunman named Madron (Richard Boone). At first, he wonders what he’s gotten into, what with Sister Mary’s grand hours of silence, her insistence on burying the badest of bad men and her Friday fasts, even when she’s starving. But he soon grows more than a little fond of her, thanks in part to her surprising frontier moxy. Complicating matters are some Mexican bandits and a Apache named Sam Red. He and Madron have a violent history that has both men seeking vengeance. <br />

Review: <br />
"The movie is enthralling, it has deepness, it is the hard core gunfighter who has lost all hope on mankind, including himself, and trapped by circumstances in a desert with a beautiful pure woman...and slowly regains hope in mankind, in himself, and ultimately falls in love...his last love...and sacrifices his life so that she may live...all enshrined in the nostalgic spell of the award winning score...a beautiful movie..."

Warning: Spoilers<br />
"This film has an interesting background. It's the first filmed in Israel that was meant to be set elsewhere; i.e. the American West. Richard Boone was hoping to help the infant Israeli film industry with its birthing pains.<br />
<br />
Each day of filming was beset with financial woes. At the end of every day Richard Boone, who was involved with production, had a meeting with the financiers. Somehow they managed to find enough money to complete the film. It holds together.<br />
<br />
The script wasn't that great but Leslie Caron and Boone gave their best performances. The romance between the nun and the gunslinger made sense within the context of the story. It was refreshing to see Boone play a not-so-bad guy once more. The death of the hero rather than the heroine makes for an unexpected and poignant ending.<br />
<br />
A word: Use caution if you're disturbed by graphic violence. In the theater version a man was emasculated in graphic and bloody detail. This scene has been edited from most versions of the film.<br />
<br />
If you get a chance to see MADRON, don't pass it by. It's worthwhile for Richard Boone and Leslie Caron. They were brilliant." Written by lexyladyjax on IMDb.com<br />
