Reviews:
"I bought this on VHS when these movies first came out. I just watched it and found it very enjoyable with a great cast. Brad Harris is at his usual best. The story falls apart and become routine near the end but ends well. There is now a complete version on Y/T to watch for free." Written by larryanderson on IMDb.com 

"You might want to drop that grade a wee bit as I'm pre-disposed to like just about every Western Al'Italia I get my hands on (except that one Alfonso Breschia made...can't remember the title), so I liked this one too. Same plot, same scenarios, but made well enough and enjoyable enough.

A yankee soldier gets framed for murdering his superior, stealing a safe from him, then knocking himself out. The dumbest court in the world then decides to hang him, but of course he escapes and tracks down the guys who framed him.

I was getting worried as he'd killed about three of these guys in ten minutes and thought things were going to get boring, but instead they got...what's the word that describes loads of Latin actors laughing for ages and stuff? Who cares if one of them is Frank Brana! Maybe think of this one as a generic, but well made Spaghetti Western. So if you like Spaghetti Westerns, you'll like this one."
