Story:<br />
Two black bounty hunters ride into a small town out West in pursuit of an outlaw.

They raise hell, chase women, and milk the locals for cash, while waiting for the opportunity to get their man.<br />
<br />
Review:<br />
Surprising decent Blaxploitation/Grandfather to Django Unchained<br />
This was way better than I expected it to be. Fred Williamson is wonderful and badass, and his sidekick is great too. The characters are believable and the situation is interesting and entertaining.<br />
<br />
The film does have the typical Blaxploitation problem of having a bad ending. one dimensional villains and supporting characters who don't go anywhere (the blacksmith character).<br />
<br />
But the film itself is well made and entertaining. give it a watch if you like the genre. Written by irishboy141 on imdb.com<br />
