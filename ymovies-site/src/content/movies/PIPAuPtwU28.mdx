Synopsis:
The Rangers in Arizona are being disbanded but Bob Houston gets them to make one more ride. They go after the outlaw gang led by Hashknife. They catch Hashknife, but he escapes taking Barbara with him and Bob and Slim have to go after him again.

Reviews:
Nothing better than an action packed western with Steele, Fuzzy St. John, Gabby and Gertie Messinger. The intrigue mounts when Hashknife's gang robs the stage and the Arizona Rangers are being dismantled. Dad Huston (John Elliot) does well in taking his son's advice and pretending the Rangers didn't get the memo. Bob and Gertie do some great family planning with their Native American friend and Chief (Greg Whitespear). Also, Fuzzy and Louise Carver in a great scene showing that they could greatly benefit from a little marriage counseling. Dad Bradbury does great in directing this fast paced western.
