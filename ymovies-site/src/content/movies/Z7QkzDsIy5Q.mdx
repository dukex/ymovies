Storyline:
Notorious gunman Quirt Evans is wounded and on the run. He arrives at a Quaker farm owned by Thomas Worth and his family where he collapses from exhaustion. Evans asks Thomas and his daughter Penelope to drive him into town in their wagon in order to send an urgent telegram. The telegram contains a land claim and is sent to the land recorder's office. The Quaker family is ignoring the town doctor's advice to rid themselves of the gunfighter and they compassionately tend to the delirious Evans. Penny Worth becomes intrigued by his ravings of past loves.When Evans regains consciousness, Penny explains to him about the Quaker credo of non-violence and way of life. Three weeks later, two desperadoes, Laredo Stevens and Hondo Jeffries, ride into town looking for Evans.Penny's younger brother, Johnny, rushes home to inform Evans of his visitors and Evans prepares to flee. Penny, now smitten with Evans, offers to run off with him. Upon hearing the sound of approaching horses, Evans grabs his revolver and, to his horror, discovers that it has been emptied. His life is in serious danger.

Reviews:
"This is one of Wayne's best movies, the simple but powerful story of a man changing for the love of a woman. It is always a great introduction to John Wayne for someone who has not appreciated his work, his best movies are about love and redemption. The Quiet Man, Stagecoach and The Angel and The Badman, are among the best movies ever made." Written by John T.-3 on IMDb.com 

"One of my all-time favorite movies and, in my opinion, one of the Duke's best. This one's got it all...comedy, drama, and redemption. Both the Duke and Gail Russell give fine lead performances supported by a colorful cast of characters. I highly recommend this movie to all." Written by mctoomey on IMDb.com 

"The Angel and the Badman is one of my favorite John Wayne movies. It has romance as well as action in it and John Wayne handles both very well. As a macho-type guy, John Wayne plays Quirt Evans perfectly. He falls in love with a woman, Gail Russell, and just watching him play that part, one can truly enjoy Wayne's character, since he plays in very few love stories. However, this one is done very well and John and Gail together are perfectly matched. I have seen many John Wayne movies. Some of them I enjoyed very much and others I did not. But this movie, in my opinion, is one of John Wayne's best. He proves that he can handle a romantic role and any woman watching this film, I can honestly say, would love to be in John Wayne's arms. He's quite a kisser! Don't miss this film." Written by Matinelli on IMDb.com
