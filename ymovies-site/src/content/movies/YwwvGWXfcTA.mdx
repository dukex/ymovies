Reviews:<br />
An amusing turn of events here. It's like if the Pope was a bad guy and Mehmet Ali Agca was the good guy, this movie twists events, uh, somewhat, and makes Wild Bill the scum of the earth, killing off Indians, taking bribes, killing people for their property, and the quest of one man, Johnny Rebel (Look THAT name up in your history books kids) to get rid of that gun totin' varmint once and for all! Ha ha! I suppose they put that in there to distract you from boring yourself out watching the many MANY MANNNY scenes of horses running around, and a white Palomino who seems to have a mind of it's own! No reason for this, unless it's some kind of really really deep metaphor involved that I missed. The ending for this actually is quite great though, as Johnny Rebel goes into town almost alone and singlehandedly kills everyone, no card game involved! WILD! Listen when one of the gang gets killed, someone yells "bang" off camera for their cue. Written by Spuzzlightyear on IMDb.com<br />
