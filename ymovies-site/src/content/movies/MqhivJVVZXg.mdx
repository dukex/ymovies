<br />
Reviews:<br />
This spaghetti western, is a comedy, with the background of the standard tortilla western: revolutionaries, federals, bank robbers and rich people hungry for money too? The modus operandi of many of the characters is greed.<br />
<br />
The comedy scenes between Gina Lollobrigida and her suitors, there are several, including one with Lee Van Cleef and the other James Mason. She is the main sexual magnet of the film, and play to always act for her benefit, to survive and finance her lifestyle. And the male characters are not fooled.<br />
<br />
Lee Van Cleef works well in a comic register, as a gang leader, not mastering everything, selling his gang for money, but very rarely getting paid.<br />
<br />
This spaghetti western stands out thanks to its romantic comedy humor in the middle of the tortilla western. What's more, supported by a great cast. It should be noted that, like all tortilla westerns, it contains its share of successful and spectacular gunfights, explosions and attacks, which are well integrated into the plot.<br />
