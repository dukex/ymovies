Synopsis:<br />
During the presidency of Ulysses S. Grant, the full-blooded Native American US Army Cavalry officer, Captain Apache, finds himself entangled in a well-planned conspiracy, while on a mission to investigate the death of the Indian Commissioner, Harry Collier. With his sole clue being the victim's cryptic dying words, "April Morning", Captain Apache will soon cross paths with the tough arms-runner, Griffin, as everyone around him who knows something about the puzzling case, eventually, ends up murdered. Is there an intricate plot and an even greater scheme of corruption behind those hideous killings? As the bullets start flying, the inquisitive Captain will shortly find out how deep the conspiracy goes.<br />
<br />
Reviews:<br />
This unique and fun Spaghetti Western is full of smart (albeit cheesy)dialogue, great action, and a groovy 60's soundtrack to boot. Memorable scenes include a shootout in a Mexican saloon overtaken by a witch, and the Captain's drug induced trip through old west ruins. Also worthy of mention is that two songs in the film are belted out by Mr. Lee Van Cleef, himself. Fans of this genre will find this one to be a real treat worthy of watching once or again and again.<br />
