<br />
Reviews:<br />
"This is the film that Jolly Films of Rome and the other producing companies were putting their hopes and money into while tossing a bone to an unknown director named Sergio Leone, giving him film ends and minimal financing to shoot a movie called The Magnificent Stranger which featured a little-known American TV actor named Clint Eastwood. BULLETS DON'T ARGUE starred Rod Cameron, a bigger name, as Pat Garrett, with Horst Frank and Angel Aranda as Billy and George Clanton, thus mixing two old west legends into a very typically American spaghetti western. It kind of reminded me of the Budd Boetticher/Randolph Scott westerns of the late fifties, with Cameron as the stoic, older authority figure bringing in the wild, younger outlaws, and is pretty darned good, doing what it sets out to do. Oddly enough the highlight of Morricone's score is the song Lonesome Billy, about the elder of the outlaw brothers. BTW I think this is the film that did so poorly at the Italian box office that it prompted Variety to report that spaghetti westerns were dead, a week or so before the Leone/Eastwood film, retitled A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, turned the film world on its ear."

"This film is a ripping off of American westerns. When I say ripping off I don't mean it is a poor film. It has the typical western elements: sheriffs and bandits. The role of the characters is well defined and at the end of the story the good will triumph on bad. Many films-loving people didn't understand why this film hadn't had success in Italy. First of all it was played by unknown actors, at least in Italy. Moreover, westerns were getting to be on the wane from 1965. But the main reason is that Italians were bored about classic westerns ("the stagecoach", "Rio Grande", "Cimarron", "saddle the wind" etc) they preferred action, shootings and a bit of violence. So the film "a fistful of dollars" released a few weeks later was a great success because it started a new era of making westerns as Italians preferred.<br />
<br />
This was one of the first westerns to have false names of director and actors so as to make it seem like an American film. Probably it was shot without recording the audio even if many actors spoke English. It was released in Italian and in English both dubbed. Rod Cameron dubbed himself."
