Storyline:
The Marshal sends John Weston to a rodeo to see if he can find out who is killing the rodeo riders who are about to win the prize money. Barton has organized the rodeo and plans to leave with all the prize money put up by the townspeople. When it appears that Weston will beat Barton's rider, he has his men prepare the same fate for him that befell the other riders.

Reviews:
"Marshal George Higgins appoints John Weston a deputy after the latter helps save the Wells Fargo office from being robbed. Higgins wants Weston to use his riding skills to enter the rodeo and prevent a gang from having the contests fixed and some of the riders killed before they win the prize money. Weston notices that Barton, a promoter in town, is the head of the crime ring and takes heed before he can enter the final races. Barton also has another sideline, robbing Carter's bank of the gate receipts following his attempted "snake bite" treatment for Weston. Very good Lone Star film for Wayne being one of Bradbury's better directorial and writing efforts. Considering Canutt was one of the riders in the rodeo, it would have been nice to see some actual riding shots instead of the stock footage. Nice interaction between Wayne and Young (she was quite fickle). The climactic fight between Wayne and Peil was a bit of a letdown, but the rest of the film was able to make up for it. Rating, based on B westerns, 7." Written by Mike-764 on IMDb.com 

"Suspenseful Gabby, Yak and Duke undercover movie with an action packed beginning. Then he gets hired by the Judge (Lafe McKee) to seek out the gang spiking the rodeo. His gorgeous daughter (Polly Ann Young) has her eyes on Duke in more ways than one. Marshal Gabby Hayes, saved by Wayne in the opening has put all his trust in him. Canutt as always is superb on both sides of the screen. Earl Dwire, although not in a major role did well as the rodeo announcer. Can Spike Barton (Edward Peil Sr). keep the scam going? See beautiful Anita Campillo in an interesting scene luring Duke away from Young and into a deadly trap." Written by frank4122 on IMDb.com
