Storyline:<br />
Mexican land-owner Gutierrez offers to save Chad Stark from hanging if Stark will agree to find and return Gutierrez' runaway son, Fidel. Stark soon finds Fidel who's joined up with an outlaw band run by Stark's former acquaintance, "the Major." Stark tricks the Major into letting him take Fidel to lay the groundwork for a projected train robbery. Stark then forces Fidel on a hazardous journey across a desert where they meet up with the Londonderry family heading west to California. Back at the Gutierrez ranch with the unhappy Fidel, Stark discovers that Fidel is not Gutierrez' son. It seems the woman Gutierrez married was, unbeknownst to him, already pregnant with another man's son. Gutierrez is now determined to avenge his honor by killing Fidel. A shoot-out results with deadly results, especially after the Major arrives on the scene. When the dust settles, Stark heads off to California where he hopes to meet up with the Londonderry's pretty daughter. Joining him is ... Fidel!<br />

Reviews:<br />
"I'm pretty picky about my Spaghetti Westerns, so it's very rare that I watch one with fair to middling ratings that I think is much better than that. This is one of those rare cases. I really don't understand all the meh-ness about it. I thought it was creative, well made and very enjoyable. It definitely has some odd touches for the genre, but I thought they worked very well and were never over the top or distracting. A solid contribution to the filone, I say!<br />

Guess IMDb's never heard that brevity is the essence of wit. This didn't need the extra two lines, IMDb. And still not enough. Is the 10 line minimum based on something or did a programmer just make that up?" Written by adrianswingler on IMDb.com.<br />

"Spara Gringo Spara is a particular favorite of this spaghetti western fan in that it combines the expected Italian western bravado and action with a respectable attempt at offering unique character relationships.<br />
<br />
While lacking the depth and intrigue of classics of the genre, such as "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly", Spara Gringo Spara (aka Shoot Gringo Shoot) does manage to avoid the confusing plot lines and over-indulging intensity that often spoils many shoot-em-up films. Westerns, at least the better ones, more often than not revolve around a simple theme of good vs. evil. And although many recently produced old-west films successfully cloud that issue ("Open Range" for one), most films of the genre are better served remaining faithful to the standard, to-the-point presentation that exemplifies the western... keep the storyline simple and punctuate it with in-your-face, gun-blazing action.<br />
<br />
Spara Gringo Spara delivers these elements without watering down the dialog, mixing in unnecessary plot twists, or exceeding the duration required to achieve its goals.<br />
<br />
The bottom line... Spara Gringo Spara makes no attempt to deliver anything beyond its capabilities. Sometimes, less is more, as this movie properly demonstrates. A nice addition to any spaghetti western collection." Written by mgolfguy57 on IMDb.com.<br />
