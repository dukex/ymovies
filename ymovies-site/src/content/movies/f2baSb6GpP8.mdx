Story:<br />
Impressed by his medical skill, a pretty female outlaw forces a young doctor at gunpoint to travel to a town run by women, where the only males who can enter either work in or patronize the local, and crooked, gambling hall. The town's independence from men is threatened by an gang of notorious outlaws and the election of a new marshal - an election in which the women, outlaws or not, cannot participate.<br />
<br />
Review:<br />
Marie Windsor plays a Barbara Stanwyck's character<br />
I mean that when you have seen those westerns starring Barbara Stanwyck such as THE FURIES, CATTLE QUEEN OF MONTANA, FORTY GUNS, THE MAVERICK QUEEN, all films where she plays a woman with guns and wearing pants instead of a skirt, you will for sure think about her after seeing this one. I agree that you also had other B westerns starring female leads carrying guns, such a DALTON GIRLS for instance and many other ones which I don't remember the titles. I won't speak of JOHNNY GUITAR, that's another matter, nearly a metaphysics movie, and not a pure entertainment film such as this one. Back to this excellent Sam Newfield B picture, compared to the rest of his filmography, it is very surprising and unusual to watch, a pure little gem. Just enjoy it, a good Sam Newfield film is rare enough not to miss it. Written by searchanddestroy-1 on imdb.com<br />
