Reviews: 
"It's not the first time that a drama of Shakespeare or another classical is adapted and free interpreted for a Spaghetti Western. The story is about the war between two rancher families: Monter and the Campos. In the Shakespeare Drama the two are named Montague and Capulet. The son of the Monter who is named Johnny not Romeo has not many experiences with Guns and Women. Fortunately he got a teacher an old outlaw called Lefty and he meets Guiletta Campos the daughter of the Campos Chief. She is espoused to another man but fells in Love with the son of her father's enemy. The cast of the two lovers are Peter Lee Lawrence and Cristina Galbò. It's interesting that both became a couple during making FURY OF JOHNNY KID and married few years later. There is obviously good chemistry between them. Nevertheless the movie is more a spaghetti western as a romantic drama with typical violent scenes, a revenge story and a buddy next to the hero. The typical Buddy story it's about an old outlaw is teaching a young fellow. The Buddy (Andrès Mejuto) is called Lefty and he has only one hand left. All actors are pretty good and the movie is without strange overacting you see in so many contributions of this genre. Somehow it's like an Adult Western without childish elements you'll find in most western from Italy.

Next to these "normal" western stories there are some extraordinary scenes. I didn't expect the end and Yes that's what I would call a weird movie. FURY OF JOHNNY KID is the only western directed by Gianni Puccini who is better known for his work on more sophisticated Movies. He did quiet a good job as also the composer Gino Peguri and the cinematography by Mario Monturi have done.

FURY OF JOHNNY KID was a big surprise for me. It's a weird Spaghetti Western for Adults with good Acting, Directing and a fine score. I enjoyed this unusual Movie with a suspenseful story and many interesting scenes and at least some connection to the great Drama of Shakespeare." Written by lostinaction on IMDb.com
