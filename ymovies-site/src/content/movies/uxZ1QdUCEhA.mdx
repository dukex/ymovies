<br />
Reviews:<br />
"Mexican homesteader George Eastman is beaten and robbed on the way to pay off his loan to a local big-wig. Turning down a chance to join a mob against the crooked moneylender, he instead goes and begs for an extension, returning home to find his parents murdered and his farm burned. Before long, he saves the life of a hired killer who teaches him the art of revenge.<br />
<br />
A very good low-budget spaghetti western, this benefits from a script that really knows how to push the viewer's emotions, vile heavies, and a couple of decent performances from Eastman and Anthony Ghidra as Django the killer.<br />
<br />
The best thing about this is Ghidra's insights into the world of the gunfighter. His and Eastman's scenes are quite compelling and are alone enough to make the film worth watching.<br />
<br />
There's also a fantastic Ennio Morricone sounding score by Roberto Pregadio." Written by FightingWesterner on IMDb.com <br />
<br />
"As you probably know, there were a number of spaghetti westerns that capitalized on the success of DJANGO, namely by renaming (during the dubbing) of characters to the name of "Django", as they did with this movie. (At least they didn't try to further the ripoff here by having the Django here dress in black and carry a machine gun, as some other films did.)<br />
<br />
Anyway, this spaghetti western is not without flaws. It's more leisurely paced than other spaghetti westerns - it takes more than 30 minutes for Eastman's character and "Django" to meet, and Eastman's training takes a considerable amount of time. Some viewers may squirm in their seats at some point. His quest for revenge is almost forgotten about along the way. The "surprise" twist that happens late in the movie will probably be no surprise to most viewers.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the production values (sets, photography, etc.) are decent, there is some good and atypical location work (green fields instead of desert), the bad guys are hateful enough, the musical score by Roberto Pregadio is first rate, and there is some interesting dialogue. No, this movie is not a classic of the genre, and certainly won't convert newbies to the genre, but if you like spaghetti westerns like me, it is acceptable." Written by Wizard-8 on IMDb.com <br />
