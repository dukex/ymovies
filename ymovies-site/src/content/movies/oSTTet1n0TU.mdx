<br />
Reviews:<br />
"This film begins with a wagon train heading west and directly through the land controlled by the Pawnee. As it so happens, one wagon in particular has lagged behind the others and is subsequently attacked by a Pawnee named "Crazy Fox" (Charles Horvath) who shoots an arrow into an older settler by the name of "Uncle Tip Alden" (Francis McDonald) before setting fire to the wagon and riding off with the livestock. Fortunately, another Pawnee named "Pale Arrow" (George Montgomery) happens to come along right afterward and surgically removes the arrow from Uncle Tip's shoulder and then takes him and his daughter "Meg Alden" (Lola Albright) to the edge of where the rest of the wagons have camped for the night. Not long afterward their only scout decides to quit and so with nobody else available to guide them through the Pawnee territory they accept the offer of a stranger who agrees to help them out. What they don't know is that this stranger is none other than Pale Arrow who may or may not have an ulterior motive. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a basic Western which, quite frankly, covered all of the bases if nothing else. Having said that, viewers looking for something to occupy themselves with for an hour or two could do worse and for that reason I have rated it accordingly." Written by Uriah43 on IMDb.com <br />
