Reviews:<br />
"I think this one has to get an award for putting all the classic Spaghetti Western elements together seamlessly into one movie. It's very 1966 and Franco Nero is obviously trying to adopt an Eastwood mannerism. For those that love these, it's an interesting transitional piece by a director that didn't do this filone. I think he did a great job and it's well worth seeing. It transcends the "must see" label because you will actually remember it, imho.<br />
<br />
Consumer warning: If you play the "have a shot of tequila when they do" game watching these, this one will waste you. They fire it down pretty regularly. It's a killer. I've never seen so many tequila and whiskey slugs in one movie. lol Maybe that's the message. "Shots not slugs!"<br />
