Synopsis:<br />
During the Civil War, Border City is a town laying on the Missouri-Arkansas border at the base of the Ozark mountains. Despite its closeness to the North-South conflict, Border City professes its neutrality and fiercely imposes an 8-mile limit to any belligerent army. Young Sally Maris is arriving into Border City, from the East Coast, on the stagecoach, at the request of her brother who runs a saloon and hotel in town. Upon approaching Border City, the stagecoach is stopped by a small Union Army patrol and passengers are checked out. The patrol commander offers to escort the stagecoach into town but on the way they are attacked by Quantrill's Raiders who kill the Union soldiers. The Raiders escort the stagecoach into town themselves. Among the Raiders are the James brothers, Charles Quantrill himself and Kate Quantrill, his wife. The town of Border City dislikes having these Raiders within the city limits and the mayor decides to send for the Union forces in order to rid Border City of the troublesome Quantrill's Raiders. The problem is the mayor of Border City owns the biggest lead mines in the region and both the Confederacy and the Union want to capture the mines so vital to the armament industry.<br />

Reviews:<br />
I'm happy to see that the more I watch westerns, the more they present themselves as a diverse genre. It was born with social issues typical of American society, which often rewrites history to benefit the status quo, but which also corrects itself and reinvents itself. Before Ray's Johnny Guitar, exactly a year earlier, there was Dwan's Woman They Almost Lynched, one of the greats of classic cinema.<br />
<br />
I was promised a great female western. And there is, it's one of the films in which sorority even gets its name, but there's much more to it. It's a movie that propagates morals and, at the same time, shows that it's not easy to follow the playbook. The very political component of the city on the edge of a tug-of-war conflict sets the tone for this ambiguity. The young lady who has the talk with the young bandit when her stagecoach is intercepted by his gang a few scenes later has to take over the saloon because the ladies who are the bastion of morality in the town reject her.<br />
<br />
It's very nice to see this kind of story in which the characters dance to the music, having to give up their principles when the going gets tough, without there being much distinction between the good guys and the bad guys. There is, but no one is predestined to die on the gallows. The great example of this is the antagonist, who escapes the duel that would have left only one alive and gets a second chance. Forgiveness that comes from you, before it comes from the society that judges you.<br />
