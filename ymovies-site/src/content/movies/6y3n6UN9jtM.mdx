Reviews:
"This movie is definitely not your average spaghetti western, and it's uniqueness is part of what makes it great.

There are really two separate stories being told in the film, and they are both given equal weight. One of them is the chasing of Jed by a revenge seeking lawman played by Telly Savalas, and the other is the dysfunctional love story of Sonny and Jed.

Franciscus, the character played by Savalas, seems out of place in a spaghetti western, wearing a long fur coat and basically being Kojak, accent and all. He even talks more like he belongs in a 1970's cop movie than a western. In one part he even calls Jed a "punk." I'm not sure, but I don't think I've ever heard that word in a spaghetti western before this one. I love when spaghetti westerns have these offbeat characters that don't belong in a western. It always makes for a cool and interesting movie. In the middle of the film, after Franciscus becomes disabled, Savalas gets to portray him as a totally different character, as his personality changes and his style of clothing becomes even more bizarre. He is truly great in this role.

Tomas Milian plays the part of Jed, a character similar to the one he portrayed in Companeros, but a bit cruder. He is fantastic as usual. He plays this type of character perfectly. His antics are a lot of fun to watch. He even eats spaghetti in this movie! I've always wanted to see that in a spaghetti western. Susan George is good for the role of Sonny. There is one part where she uses 1960's slang when she speaks. You've just gotta love these Italian westerns!

Ennio Morricone's score is brilliant, and one of his more memorable. It is not the typical spaghetti western score, but it fits, and has that haunting Euro-movie style.

Definitely a must see for Euro-western fans" Written by spider89119 on IMDb.com
