Reviews:
"until Mr. Tarantino recently included this film in his recent 'festival-of-classics', i thought only my family knew of it. i happened upon it on late-nite KTLA TV, and as my true San Diego mansion was 120 miles from LA, my 'hill-top' location, still allowed me to record it, on Beta-Max. i have seen this termed 'trash'. 'Shame, Shame, come back Shame! this, as 'Any Gun Can Play'('Kookie's best performance)is not your usual 'pasta-western'. no Leonie 'dark-side'--rather trenchant humor, and very-oddly, a rather strong link to modern physics. What??? the theme of 'perceptor-as-creator' is the 'base' for many scenes. those unaware of this line of 'quantum-physics' simply will see what sometimes appears as absurd, actually agrees with same. 'i pity the poor fool'---

i Love 16mm 'hand-held' photo-tech, and as both fixed, or 'hand-held', this unknown masterpiece blows-away the typical American camera-work. in fact, one may pause Any frame and observe a bit of Absolute Superb 'Modern-Impressionism', that should grace any Great museum---the colors, balance--Perfect. Captivating. This film-art 'nails' any cognizant viewer from opening scenes on--

'Performance-wise'? one must remember this is 'dubbed' to English', so some lines may seem clumsy. yet the characters from the Mexican revolutionary, Russian thief. false Nun, etc. are brilliantly directed. Plot-wise? so it's the old 'gunslinger's-riches-hunt' formula? who cares? this one is Supreme, Breathtaking cinema work, for camera-alone.

i was so taken with this, i spent +bucks to reach the 'hidden' producer. and i did. 1st he wanted to know how i found him, as the Italian 'IRS' was haunting him. then he informed me the 'rights' had been sold to an American co., seeking a flop as a tax-shelter--HA! sound like 'The Producers'? he also mentioned this film was a huge success in Europe and South America, yet ignored here, as Hollywood controls distribution."
