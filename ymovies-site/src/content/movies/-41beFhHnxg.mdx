Four episodes of "Dusty's Trail" (1973) coupled together into a feature film. In a similar situation to "Gilligan's Island" (1964) and even starring Bob Denver again, Dusty is a bumbling assistant to Wagonmaster Callahan. Thanks to Dusty's bungling, they are soon separated from the wagon train and lost in the wilderness. The characters parallel those of Gilligan's show. Written by Fred Blorgs

Reviews:
Warning: Spoilers
"It *IS* true, this movie is NOT Citizen Kane, BUT, it is a VERY FUN Family Movie! As a parent, I was always on the lookout for various types of movies that I could keep in the house without having to explain explicit sexual situations, violence, foul language, ad nauseum.

This is light fare, silly, vastly amusing even lots of groaning! You can watch it with the kids, with the grandparents, with your favorite religious leader totally without embarrassment. It's a feel-good type movie. If you're the type of parent who likes to use situations as teaching/learning moments, there's great opportunities to do this here.

I saw this as a teen and remembered it fondly. Saw it again with the kidlets and enjoyed it. Would I bring my film-critics meetup over to watch it? Nope. Was there laughter and groaning? Yep.

Am I glad I kept it in the house? Yep.

My favorite scene? Half way through when the narrator uses the map to show where everyone is located and why. Why is that funny? You watch it and tell me!" Written by wizardwizard on IMDb.com.
