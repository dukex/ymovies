Intent on murder, the vicious cut-throats of the pitiless bandit, Sam Clayton, ride into dusty Juno City, rob the bank, and kill the pacifistic man of religion, Father John, in front of the church.

Can Diamante Lobo, the feared ex-bounty hunter, right a wrong, and in the process, rid the town of Clayton's jackals?<br />
<br />
Reviews:<br />
"I thought this was an excellent picture. Lee Van Cleef does an excellent job playing the role of Father John and the role of Lewis. Jack Palace was excellent in his role as Sam Clayton. The reason I bought this movie was Sybil Danning. You didn't see much of Sybil Danning body in this because it was a western but, she was excellent in her role as Jenny the owner of the saloon. Her talents as an actress really shined in this picture. So, with that in mind, and because this movie kept my interest through the entire picture I'm giving this movie 10 weasels stars because of Sybil Danning and the level of action , adventure and drama this movie had from beginning to end.
