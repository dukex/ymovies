Reviews:<br />
"Start with a good story, based slightly on characters by William Colt MacDonald and written by Robert Emmet Tansey, then cast some of the best Western players in Hollywood, including Guinn Williams and Al St. John, as well as Lafe McKee and Glenn (billed as Glen) Strange, and a good movie should be no surprise.<br />
<br />
The warmth of the relationships between and among the characters, including "Tucson Smith," Williams, and "Stoney Martin" (not Brooke), St. John, helps make this an unusual B Western.<br />
<br />
There is some clever dialogue and byplay, such as when Tucson and Stoney enter a saloon with guns drawn, and writers and actors and director all made everything work together just right.<br />
<br />
It's a darn good movie and I do hope you watch it."<br />
