Reviews:
"When the producers searched for three females to star in "Doc Hooker's Bunch", I was proud that all three were found in my Talent Agency. Both Gaetana Campbell and Danielle Hibbard had extensive stage experience as well as film experience. They both had toured the country in Dinner Theater Productions co-starring with various "names". At the time, Linda Mann was a recent graduate of S.M.U. This was her first "on-screen" appearance. If the film had been produced in Hollywood, probably they would never have had a chance at the roles, although they were excellent as "Doc Hooker's Bunch". But, because the film was made in Texas, in 1976, it did not receive the recognition that it deserved. It is sad that these three very talented actresses were unable to use their starring roles as springboards to additional work. This is not a great film by any standards, but it is enjoyable. Some of the cast were better than others. Dub Taylor, as Doc Hooker, was his normal charming self. His son, Buck Taylor, is a natural cowboy.

I'd love to have a copy of the film in my library." Written by Joy-31 on IMDb.com
