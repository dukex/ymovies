Storyline:<br />
A cowboy escapes from jail with the help of his girlfriend, and goes after the men he believes are responsible for his brother being shot down by lawmen.<br />
<br />
Reviews:<br />
"Cheney Holland (Don Megowan) is a man with issues, that's for sure! He's not the typical villain either....more like a berserker than anything else...attacking and killing with little real motivation other than he likes to kill and seems to feel entitled to do it for the least little thing.<br />
<br />
When the story begins, a gang of bandits have just stolen a shipment of guns and ammo. The posse is close behind and they shoot Cheney's brother. Instead of running for cover like the rest of the gang, he stays behind with his dying brother...and is soon apprehended.<br />
<br />
Marshall Gordon (Jim Davis) has some sympathy for Cheney. After all, they grew up together and he realizes the man isn't all bad. This is a HUGE mistake, as at the funeral for Cheney's brother, Cheney makes his escape and kills a man for little reason. He then feels his mission in life is getting retribution for his brother...a man killed committing a robbery! In fact, Cheney is such a mess that he even attacks his old gang!! What's to become of him....and what's the Marshall going to do to redeem himself?<br />
<br />
This is an unusual western...and that's its biggest plus. On the negative side, the Marshall seems a bit dim and difficult to understand at times...and the story was pretty predictable after Cheney went on his killing rampage. But considering it was a cheap film made for very little, it provides a decent return on its investment." Written by MartinHafer on IMDb.com <br />
