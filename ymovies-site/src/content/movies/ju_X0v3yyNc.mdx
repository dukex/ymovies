Story:<br />

Champion), her fiancé and crusading newspaperman, his been mysteriously murdered in Sentinel, Texas. Despite the price on his head, Sands comes north to the panhandle to find his brother's killer.<br />
<br />
Review:<br />
John Sands (Rod Cameron), a reformed gunman, now a storekeeper in a Mexican border town, again straps on gun belt and six-shooters to find the killer of his brother. Fists and bullets fly when he finds that he must contend not only with badmen, but with lawmen who remember his outlaw past.<br />
<br />
Shot amidst rugged Lone Pine, California scenery in glowing Sepiatone, Panhandle is a top drawer western with a strong plot, tense moments that stars Rod Cameron as a reformed gunman who straps his six shooters back on to avenge the murder of his brother, and he's as tight-lipped as ever while courting Anne Gwynne - a saloon gal the villain has set his lustful sights - as well taking on Myron Reedly's villainous town boss. Blake Edwards does some scene stealing as Floyd Schofield who is the chief villain's hired thug and a Billy the Kid wannabe with an unhinged side. Loved the scene where the thug asks Cameron about his showdown with Billy the Kid, Cameron obliges, building up to the story, which really excites the thug and he's waiting for the climax where Billy the Kid declines the showdown. "What happened?" asks the thug, and Cameron replied "then Billy the Kid killed me." That really got up the thug's nose! Actually there's some nifty dialogue, as sharp as the action - chases, showdowns and one in a rain and a rather energetic fistfights, all down with gusto. It's a solid western that is a little underrated. It was remade as the Texican starring that other fast-gun actor Audie Murphy. Written by coltras35 on imdb.com<br />
