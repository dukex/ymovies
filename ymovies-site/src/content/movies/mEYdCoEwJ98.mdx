Storyline:
Robert Gunner is Roger “Stretch” Hawkins, leader of a gang that is forced to escape across barren land after robbing a bank in South Africa.

They make it to a near ghost town called Yellow Rock, where the only inhabitants are an old man (Vincent Price) and his granddaughter “Willie” Decker (Diana Ivarson).

“Willie” and her swaying hips become the focus of attention for most of the gang members. But not Dandy (Bob Courtney), who’s spending more time wondering why the old timer continues to live in these here parts.

Soon enough, he discovers the answer: The old man and his daughter have been working a gold mine.

And, naturally, men who would rob a bank won’t hesitate to covet an old man’s gold.

Nor will they hesitate to break Stretch’s word after he agrees to let the old man keep half if he’ll tell where the gold is hidden.

But Stretch plans to keep his promise, and that leads to new friction among the bank robbers. Written on https://onceuponatimeinawestern.com

Reviews:
"After the battle in American Civil War the dying Virgil Cane tells Confederate officer Wishbone Cutter about diamonds hidden in a cave along the Buffalo River.Coming back Cutter finds his wife and her new husband.After violent fight he sets out with his Irish-Cherokee companion Half-Moon O'Brian and geologist Amos Richmond to find the diamonds.Along the journey they meet a young woman Drusilla Wilcox in a nearly catatonic state and take her with them.As they head up into the mountain Half-Moon realizes that it is the Mountain of Demons,which is cursed by the spirit of Chikara who promised to kill all who ventured into its domain."The Spirit of Chikara" is an interesting mix of ugly western and eerie horror.The acting is believable and the climax is very surprising.The scene of two horses falling down from the slope is shocking and unsettling.8 out of 10." Written by HumanoidOfFlesh

"Watch Predator Watch this

Familiar isn't it, Jungle coming to life, invisible enemies, a lone girl who has experienced the terrible thing that comes from the trees. The brave Indian tracker, its all there. Predator by any other name, and worth watching. Forget the other reviews, this was blockbuster (popular soundtrack The Band, horror, fear , scares, b grade cast?)

Great cast they are familiar.

Just watch it, its good.

The director should have made more films, he had a talent and I think it was wasted, I loved it Earl, you did well." Written by johnfernie-1
