Storyline:
The horse herds of rancher John Baker are being rustled by his neighbor, Mack Larkin who is working with Baker's foreman Bert. "Phantom" (the original "Starlight"), a wild stallion, is blamed for inducing the horses to run away. Baker puts a price on the head of the stallion. Wandering cowhand Tom Riley, with his sidekick Windy, feels the horse isn't to blame and talks Baker into giving him two days to capture and break the horse. Despite the handicaps thrown in his path by Larkin, Riley manages to capture "Phantom.". The horse leads him to a hidden valley where Larkin keeps the rustled stock. Aided by Windy and Bert, who has a change of heart, after learning that Larkin his been double-crossing him, Tom is able to capture the rustler and his gang, and "Phantom" is turned loose to resume his free ways.

Reviews:
"There is some clever dialogue, including where the female lead, played by the unknown-to-me Alice Dahl, says, after Tom, played by Tom Tyler, explains his idea on how to catch the wild horse, "The weak female always lures the brave male." Then Tom replies, "I guess that's what makes the world go 'round." And when in fact the wild horse gets together with the woman's mare, he gets to say again, "I guess that's what makes the world go 'round."

Cute and clever dialogue in a script that also has some holes. For example, Tom decides early on, with no apparent reason, the horse is not really the thief.

The editing and directing could both be tighter, and, worst of all, the fight scenes lacked the choreography of Yakima Canutt, and looked ... lame, un-realistic ... at least un-movie-realistic.

Oh, one other complaint: The female costumes. All the women were dressed for about 1935, even though the men looked about 1880. I've seen that in many another western, but it is still jarring, very anachronistic.

All the players were acceptable, except possibly Miss Dahl, and she was cute. But Slim Whitaker gave one of his usual great performances and the venerable Lafe McKee shone also, as usual.

The chief bad guy is another unknown-to-me actor, Richard Alexander, billed here as Dick Alexander. He was very believable, kinda clumsy and gauche, and pretty much what I would expect of someone his size trying to outwit his neighbor. Intriguing performance.

I very much recommend "Coyote Trails," despite the pointless generic title. Hey, Tom Tyler is in it."
