Storyline:
(1968) Lang Jeffries, Fernando Sancho, Femi Benussi, Carlos Gaddi. A unique Euro-western with the hero as an astrologist who wears a leopard suit. Sure, theres a revenge theme, but overall this is a different brand of spaghetti. Its very moody and feels like a Euro-horror film in spots. Aka Requeim for a Gringo Color, 16mm

Reviews:
""Requiem para un gringo" is the kind of eurowestern that is hard to define. The main character is dressed in a Leopard suit...but he's also an Astrologist!!! Apart from that, the story is simple as in many westerns vengeance is the only point, but not the usual vengeance, I wont say much, don't want to spoil it...I gave you a clue already.

L. Merino, the director, was more interested in horror and sci-fi than in westerns, maybe that is why this film looks (and works) as an horror film in many moments, which makes it much more interesting and bizarre, the dialogues are somewhat silly, but the camera work is very rich and the acting is good enough, as you can imagine the movie is full of stereotypes as it was made in Spain in the late sixties "golden age" of Spanish westerns. Marisa Paredes (Pedro Almodovar's favorite actress) appears in this film (at the age of 18) more beautiful than ever, but also check out for other beautiful women...

Must say that I enjoyed the movie a lot. Don't miss this one if you have the chance." Written by bizz-2 on IMDb.com

"This movie is a lot of fun to watch. It's a riveting story with a touch of peculiarity, some great characters, and an amazing music score.

The film is a tale of justice and revenge, as a man returns home to his ranch after some sort of military service, and discovers that his brother has been killed by a gang of outlaws. The basic plot is typical spaghetti western fare, but what makes this movie stand out is its style.

The main character has kind of a mystical aura about him because of his uncanny ability to predict the weather, and use it to his advantage. He also has a knack for seeming to appear out of nowhere to surprise his targets. Lang Jeffries's acting in the film is a bit wooden for the role of such an interesting character, but the fantastic performances by Carlo Gaddi as the slimy, menacing outlaw Ted Corbin, and the always great Fernando Sancho as Porfirio, the gang leader who is losing his grip, make up for it.

There is a very odd implementation of zoom shots in the camera work during one particular scene as the film approaches its climax. Rather than the usual sustained, intensity-building close-ups that Sergio Leone was so fond of, the director here uses a rapidly zooming in and out camera for a more unsettling effect. This turns out to be one of the most memorable parts of the movie.

The music score is perhaps the best part of this film. The opening theme is one of my favorites, and is one of those unforgettable tunes that will play in your mind over and over long after the movie is done. The soundtrack contributes tremendously to the atmosphere of the film, especially the organ parts.

This one is a must-see for fans of the spaghetti-western genre." Written by spider89119 on IMDb.com
