Storyline: <br />
Ted Hayden and his pal Dusty Rhodes come across a dying outlaw, Gatt Ganns. On Ganns's person, they find a letter of introduction to rancher Gentry implicating Gentry in the disappearance of Ted's kid brother Jim and the murder of their father many years earlier. Ted takes on Ganns's identity and pretends to go to work for Gentry, while actually looking for further evidence that Gentry did indeed murder his father and abduct his brother. Written by Jim Beaver <br />

Reviews:<br />
"He's "Gat Ganns - murderer." Duke's got a price on his head but lucky for him trusted sidekick Gabby Hayes as Dusty is right by his side. Now he has to go to work for the man who stole his dad's ranch, Lloyd Whitlock. His henchmen with Yakima Canutt would love to get a piece of the action. So the stage is set early on for the great action to follow. Enter two actors who have worked with many western stars, beautiful Virginia Brown Faire and Lafe McKee who plays her father. Whitlock is also gunning for their ranch so things get pretty dicey for Duke and Gabby. Throw in a great performance of an abused child by Billy O'Brien (Spuds) makes West Of The Divide a great early western." Written by frank4122 on IMDb.com<br />
<br />
"It doesn't get any better than John Wayne in shootouts, fisticuffs, a runaway stage coach and chase scenes. Gabby Hayes is clean-shaven but as feisty as ever. Who better to play John Wayne's love interest then silent screen leading lady Virginia Brown Faire. Lafe McGee, Earle Dwire, and Yak round out a wonderful cast with Robert Bradbury directing. In the poverty row era, Lone Star put out some great action-packed westerns." Written by hines-2000 on IMDb.com<br />
<br />
"Frequently used story gets a good presentation here in "West of the Divide," and the excellent cast helps ensure high quality.<br />
<br />
Young John Wayne and grizzled George Hayes start with what I learned in college theater-history classes was called a "feather-duster" scene, where characters -- such as a maid, with a feather-duster -- tell the background of the story, today called "the back story."<br />
<br />
It's kinda corny, but isn't too damaging.<br />
<br />
Probably even in 1934 what was about to happen was predictable, but, before that predictable ending, enough happens in between it should hold the viewer's interest. It held mine.<br />
<br />
When the hero meets the leading lady, there is no poor-writing instant romance. In fact, there is no real contact. It's an unusual boy-meets-girl.<br />
<br />
That girl is Virginia Faire Brown, who is shown with 74 credits, although she never rose to be a major player and certainly not a star. But she is very attractive, even elegant, with an unusual dark-haired beauty.<br />
<br />
Her character's father is played by the veteran Lafe McKee. The sheriff is by that veteran, and very talented actor, who didn't, alas, often enough get to show just how good an actor he was, Earl Dwire.<br />
<br />
Chief bad guy is played by "Loyd Whitlock," who is usually known as Lloyd Whitlock, a very busy man with more than 200 credits!<br />
<br />
OK, good story, great cast ably performing, lots of riding scenes, and a no-music-track realism that should keep you pinned to your seat. And if you want to see it, there's a good print at YouTube." Written by morrisonhimself on IMDb.com<br />
