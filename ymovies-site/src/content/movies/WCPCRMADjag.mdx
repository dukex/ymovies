Synopsis:<br />
In 1809, famed American explorer Meriwether Lewis (Evan Williams) died of gunshot wounds at Grinder's Stand on the Natchez Trace, an isolated wilderness road connecting Nashville, Tennessee, to Natchez, Mississippi. Did the Governor of Upper Louisiana commit suicide as history reports or was his end far more sinister? In this mystery/thriller from writer/director Clark Richey, competing versions of Lewis's death are imagined by ornithologist Alexander Wilson (Billy Slaughter), an agent of Thomas Jefferson and a friend to Lewis, during an interview with Priscilla Grinder (Amye Gousset), the only supposed witness to the explorer's final night alive, and a tense encounter with her husband Robert (Sonny Marinelli).<br />
<br />
Reviews:<br />
"The film Mysterious Circumstance has history, drama, and mystery all rolled into one movie. It's a great one to watch! The mystery of Meriwether Lewis' death is not well-known, and this movie gives the possibilities about what happened.<br />
<br />
While portraying the mystery behind his death, the movie also entertains with the stories that could have led up to his demise. Each story shows a different set of events that led to the same outcome - the death of Meriwether Lewis. All stories seemed very possible to me.<br />
<br />
Audiences will see great acting, beautiful cinematography, and first-rate directing from Clark Richey.<br />
<br />
An added bonus is seeing Rex the dog portray Meriwether Lewis' dog Seaman."<br />
