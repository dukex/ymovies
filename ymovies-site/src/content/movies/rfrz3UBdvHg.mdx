Synopsis:
When Bob "Bitter Creek" Yauntis (Rod Cameron) is accused by Belle Starr (Isabel Jewell), Queen of the outlaws of Cherokee Flats, of disobeying her orders and killing the local Marshal, he is enraged and kills her. He takes charge of the gang. The new Marshal, Tom Jackson (George Montgomery), meets Rose (Ruth Roman), Belle's daughter who thinks Tom is responsible for her mother's death. He sets out to track down the gang and prove his innocence to Rose.

Reviews:
A-grade western with an exciting script by W.R. Burnett (author of Little Caesar and The Asphalt Jungle) and direction by Lesley Selander that is far more slick and stylish than his usual standard. There's plenty of action and the pace is fast.

Rod Cameron and Fred Libby contribute interesting character portrayals. Ruth Roman fills the title role quite agreeably, while George Montgomery lends some skilful horsemanship to the climactic chase. (A pity that his fist fight with Jack Lambert is so obviously staged with doubles).

The supporting cast is strong and production values, including the atmospheric photography by William Sickner, excellent.
