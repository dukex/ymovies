Storyline:<br />
A border-town became the subject of heated political turmoil between the US & Mexico when a Mexican bandit starts killing as many US soldiers as he can.<br />
<br />
Reviews:<br />
"In a disputed border town, the US Army waits for word from Washington as to the rightful country it belongs, while dealing with a rowdy pack of Mexican soldier/bandits. Into the mix rides seemingly mysterious stranger Anthony Steffan, who looks like a dandy but has a few deadly tricks up his sleeve.<br />
<br />
Though derivative of about a thousand other Italian westerns, Gentleman Killer has a lot of rousing action and fast gun play, making it worthwhile, if not essential viewing and very easy to forgive whatever flaws there are.<br />
<br />
The bandit leader is played by Spanish actor Eduardo Fajardo, whom fans of the genre should recognize from his role as the psychotic ex-Confederate in Sergio Corbucci's Django. He's pretty good here too and quite a scene-stealer.<br />
<br />
There's also great score by Ennio Morricone's frequent conductor Bruno Nicolai. This time, Nicolai and Morricone trade places, with Ennio taking control of the orchestra." Written by FightingWesterner on IMDb.com. <br />
<br />
"Shamango (a.k.a. "Joe" depending on which dubbed version you watch) comes into a town where Mexican bandits try to control. He seems to be a weakling everybody's making fun of, but gets really mean after a few insults. Doesn't sound new, because there is nothing new. But: this a perfect little genre movie, no disappointments, well worth spending 90 minutes of your precious time on. The actors Anthony Steffen as Shamango and Eduardo Fajardo as the Mexican colonel (with an evil grin that makes crocodiles give up their job) are doing well, so is Bruno Nicolai with his powerful music and cameraman Francisco Marin with his sinister pictures."
