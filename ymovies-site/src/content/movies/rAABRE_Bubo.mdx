Reviews:
"Everything, but everything, is right in this movie. It deals with basic human emotion, presented in a very fundamental way that hits you over and over again right in the gut. It is as 'true' to human nature as any movie could be.

You see all the basic human virtues and vices here. But what most impressed me is that you see something Hollywood seems to have forgotten altogether: basic human decency. The way Ringo (John Wayne) treats Dallas (Claire Trevor), whom some of the other riders on the stagecoach ostracize because she appears to have been a prostitute, goes to the very basis of what we should all admire as human decency. He isn't nice to her because he wants to be 'nice'. God forbid. He is good to her because she is good to others. She earns his respect, just as Mary Magdaleine earns that of the Christ.

The cinematography in this movie is astounding. You see painting after painting, carefully composed.

But it is the presentation of basic human virtues, stripped of all social pretense, that hits you in the gut. And no movie does that better than this."

"I admit I am not a huge western fan, but there have been some I have really liked. Stagecoach is no exception, in fact it is a brilliant film not just as a western but of any genre really. Everything about it is wonderful, and I can see why Orson Welles watched this apparently 40 times preparing for Citizen Kane. The cinematography is gorgeous, and as always the Monument Valley locations are magnificent. The music is very well done too, and the story while simple always grips. The script is clever and well written and all the characters are credible. On top of that the big chase sequence for me has to be one of the finest action set pieces for any film. The special thing about these characters are that by the end of the film they aren't as they are initially seen to be. John Ford's direction is superb, and the acting is excellent, not just from John Wayne who gives one of his better performances here but also from the likes of John Carradine. Thomas Mitchell though is the one that steals the show. Overall, a fine film and a benchmark in the western genre. 10/10"
