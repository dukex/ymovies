Review:
"BROTHER OUTLAW is a solid if unspectacular addition to the spaghetti western genre, directed by Eoardo Mulargia, who previously made DON'T WAIT, DJANGO...SHOOT! amongst many other entries in the genre. Thankfully it's much better than the aforementioned film, thanks to a well-paced narrative, plenty of well-directed action, and an interesting plot. It's clear that Mulargia learnt plenty since that earlier western he shot.

The good-looking Tony Kendall plays Dakota, the Sheriff of a small town assailed by bank robbers. This dastardly criminal gang successfully manage to pin the blame for their latest crime on the sheriff, whom is promptly shipped off to a hard labour camp for x amount of years. Thankfully for him his brother is a real outlaw and breaks him out of the camp so that the pair can track down and bring justice to the real culprits.

This is an affectionately-made western with all the usual tropes of the genre: the opening stage coach chase (which goes on for about ten minutes but feels like an hour), the hero getting captured and beaten and escaping, lots of duels, shoot-outs and people getting shot off horses, plus some very nice location photography with Italian landscapes standing in for the Old West. Kendall was always an adept hero and he's well supported by a game cast. BROTHER OUTLAW is no classic but it's certainly an entertaining enough entry in a crowded genre."
