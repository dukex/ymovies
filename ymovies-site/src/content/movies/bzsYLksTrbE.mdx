Reviews: 
Warning: Spoilers
"Warning: One or two slight spoilers ahead! I recently began collecting any and all spaghetti westerns that I have been able to get my hands on. I had no information on this title, other than knowing Anthony Steffen stars. Now I have seen numerous Steffen Westerns and have not been particularly impressed with his movies nor his acting. But this movie changed my opinion of him DRAMATICALLY! The story centers on 2 Bounty Hunters (Steffen and Mark Damon)that ride into the town of "Blackstone" after killing an entire gang of wanted men. Once in town they find themselves in the middle of rash of murders and a corrupt Sheriff who is working for the local "Rich Man" who, in turn, is trying to control all the land because the railroad is coming through.

A few plot twists to keep you guessing, and some great acting all the way around provide for an entertaining Spaghetti! This is not your typical "revenge" theme Spaghetti Western.

The chemistry between Steffen and Damon is perfect. I can say with almost certainty that the U.S. television series "Alias Smith and Jones" drew heavily from this film! I HIGHLY recommend this film to not only fans of Spaghetti Westerns, but Western fans in general. The plot is cohesive and interesting, the scenes well edited, the cinematography excellent and the gun-play is perfect. No over-acting here except maybe the maniacal laughing at the end by Steffen...although it's not over the top.

A MUST-SEE FOR SPAGHETTI FANS!!!" Written by rockerace on IMDb.com

"Anthony Steffen and Mark Damon play two bounty hunters who venture into a town to collect a large unearned bounty, but are instead caught up in a local land war caused by a crooked sheriff and his gang of bandits over the impending arrival of the railroad. Pretty typical spaghetti b western fair, Its not very memorable but also doesn't take itself very seriously despite being quite brutal at times. However its made enjoyable by its quick pace, the presence of genre veterans Steffen and Damon, and some nice direction from Rafael Romero Marchent. Steffen will always be one of my favorites when it comes to the genre." Written by b_kite on IMDb.com
