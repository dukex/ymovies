Reviews:<br />
"This movie includes most every cliche from every prior western movie. And yet it also includes a bit extra that makes it worth a look. The main advantage is the impish charm of Marty Robbins    his performance is good enough to make me wonder why he didn't have more of a movie career. I think he could have gone much farther."<br />

<br />
"The main appeal is the way you never know who's side to be on. The ending is shocking and will leave an impression on you."<br />
