Storyline:
Anthony Steffan plays Gary McGuire, a renown carnival show trick-shot artist nicknamed Hurricane West with a secret past.

As a boy, he fired a shot that caused a stampede. Three men were killed, including his brother. He was whipped as punishment, leaving a scar on his neck.

Gary perceives that scar as a sign that he should never resort to violence against another man and that there will be severe repurcussions if he does.

So while his quick draw and markmanship make him the star of a traveling circus, Gary cowers in fear when confronted with a real-life need for violence.

Among Gary’s adoring fans is an orphaned boy named Tony Murphy, who’s hoping Hurricane West might help him reclaim the family farm stolen years earlier on a night bandits raided the property, killing his father.

Turns out that was part of a land grab scheme devised by a Lewistown saloon owner named Coleman and his lead gunman Roy Elroy (Giovanni Ciafriglia). What they don’t know is that Tony’s dad hid $30,000 on the farm they stole, and only Tony knows the money’s location.

What Tony doesn’t know is that Elroy is the man who shamed Gary in front of a circus crowd, prompting him to leave the show and bury his troubles in booze. Written by Mark Franklin on http://onceuponatimeinawestern.com

Reviews:
Warning: Spoilers
"Under the stage name "Hurricane West", Gary McGuire (Anthony Steffen) is a highly skilled shootist who stars in a circus act. A boy, Tony Murphy (Marco Steffenelli who is Benito Stefenelli's son) worships Gary, but Gary is actually a coward. When Al Roy (Ken Wood) and his friends humiliates Gary, he turns to heavy drinking. After Coleman (Richard Wyler) threatens to torture Tony, Gary mans up and refuses to give Coleman any information. In a later disagreement, Roy kills Coleman. Gary regains his self respect, and his circus friends help him to eliminate Roy and his criminal gang." Written by marthahunter on IMDb.com.

"A decent Spaghetti Western in which the hero turns out to be a coward, but needs to redeem himself if he’s going to save the life of a young friend — not to mention his own dignity.

In a neat twist early in the film, Elroy and his gang rob a sheepman heading West. When they stop to split the money, he guns down the other five gang members so he can keep it all to himself.

Gary has joined the posse trailing the bandits and watches all of this go down. He can’t muster the courage to draw on Elroy as he rides off with the loot. But when the other members of the posse return and assume he’s responsible for the five dead bandits, he takes credit for single-handedly wiping them out.

Luisa Baratto plays Maggie, the circus performer in love with Gary. Gia Sandri is Dora, the saloon girl who learns about the hidden $30,000 and makes sure the word gets back to Coleman. Nello Pazzafini is leader of the circus in which Gary stars and Tom Felleghy is Brody, Tony’s guardian who’s nevertheless in cahoots with Coleman."
