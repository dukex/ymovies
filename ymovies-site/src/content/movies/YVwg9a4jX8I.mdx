Story:
A quintet of travelers journey in a wagon through Comanche county includes a tinhorn and his woman, a sheriff escorting an accused murderer, and a sea captain with a checkered past. After a renegade Indian tells them about a virgin gold field as thanks for saving his life, the group becomes fixated on the gold as greed becomes their prime motivation.

Review:
Classic, low budget Western Action:
Fresh off his success as award winning editor on "High Noon", Elmo Williams takes the Directors chair here for the first time. Often compared to Ford's "Stagecoach" this character study of lust and greed is more reminiscent of "Treasure of Sierra Madre." Bridges is superb as the tight lipped convict, Trask(the Tall Texan), however the real acting kudos go to Adler and Cobb as sniveling peddler and sadistic sea captain, respectively. The picture slowly builds to an action packed climax and a deliberately inconclusive ending. This is perhaps the finest picture from Lippert Inc. Written by bux on imdb.com
