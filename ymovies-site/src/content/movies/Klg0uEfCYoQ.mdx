Storyline:<br />
Young adventurer Gipo owns one fifth of a rock illustrating the location of a rich gold mine. Risking his life more than once and with the help of the beautiful hooker, Lulu Belle, our hero sets out to recover the missing pieces.<br />
<br />
Reviews:<br />
"A map to a fortune in gold has been split into five pieces. Five different individuals have a piece of the map and some would do just about anything to get the other pieces. Our two heroes, a shiftless drifter who happens to be good with a gun and a beautiful saloon singer, each have a piece of the puzzle. They form an uneasy alliance and decide to work together to get the treasure.<br />
<br />
Miss Dynamite (or All the Brothers of the West Support Their Father - what a stupid name) has two things going for it that should have made it a winner with me - it's a Spaghetti Western starring Marisa Mell. In this case, however, that wasn't enough. My biggest gripe is with the script. I've never been a big fan of mixing comedy into a Western and this movie doesn't change that. I admit, there were a couple of scenes that I found funny (Lionel Stander crossing the river on the shoulders of his henchmen being one that almost brought me to actual laughter), but most were more groan-inducing than anything else. Also, I didn't care at all for the ending. Our heroes end up with all the map pieces and . . . well, that's about it. We never see them using the map or finding the gold. Kind of anticlimactic. Finally, while I enjoyed seeing Marisa Mell and liked her character, I can't say the same for her co-star, Antonio Sabato. His Jeepo character got on my nerves right from the start. Overall, Miss Dynamite was a real disappointment.<br />
<br />
I've cut Miss Dynamite a break when it comes to the rating. I watched the 72 minute version available on Amazon. IMDb lists the runtime at over 90 minutes. I'm not sure the extra 20+ minutes would have made a difference (in fact, it might have made things worse), but I'm willing to cut the movie a bit of slack and give it a 4/10 instead of the 3/10 I initially decided on."
