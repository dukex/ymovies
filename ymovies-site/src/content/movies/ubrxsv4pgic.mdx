A trio of thieves plot to steal a town's silver shipment but a turn of events makes them the town's heroes.

After robbing a stagecoach, the bandit Billy Joe Cudlip (Lee Van Cleef) becomes the friend of Czech immigrant Ben Novack, an honest engineer working for the mine company of Silverton. Cudlip is determined to "go straight", and after earning the trust of the citizens he is named the new sheriff of Silverton. But does he really want the job, or just access to the valuable shipments of the town's silver?

Stars: Lee Van Cleef, Antonio Sabato, Gordon Mitchell
Runtime: 78 minutes

www.ROTTENTOMATOES.com: Unlike Clint Eastwood, who in the 1960s was cast as the Man With No Name, Beyond the Law star Lee Van Cleef has a name, and a very functional one. Van Cleef is known to one and all as Bandit Turned Sheriff. Actually, a more appropriate cognomen would be Bandit Turned Sheriff But Still a Bandit, since Van Cleef only pretends to reform so that he can steal a cavalry payroll. Since it's hard to watch Beyond the Law with a straight face to begin with, the producers wisely decided to turn this spaghetti western into a semi-comedy. Released in Italy in 1967 as Al Di La Della Legge, Beyond the Law was distributed in the US in 1971.
