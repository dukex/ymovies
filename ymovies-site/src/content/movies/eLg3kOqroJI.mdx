Reviews:<br />
"Here is a nice little gem of a story that was out there all this time until I discovered it on TCM. Most excellent story-telling that uses 'gold" to capture and awaken the viewers emotions and wonder what it was like to mine for gold and start from scratch. There are many riches in the world and gold continues to have the allure especially when it was discovered and then mined for the first time. The idea of working hard to strike it rich is not far-fetched. People liked to work and wanted to work so why not work at finding gold? The thing is there were many working to take your hard work and claim it for themselves. Good movie to study human nature by. Greed! That's what does it to all! Here a man stays focused which is a good thing but then it turns into an obsession forsaking what is a true riches for the promise of earthly riches. The main character paid a steep price as did others to find out what the true riches are and were and will always be. This lesson goes on to this day and people still don't get it. It all stays here. Naked you come and naked you go so there must be a reason to be here. If it was just for gold etc., we would have known that deep reason by now. The movie brings the point home really nice. Some good moving scenes too. Reminds me of all the billionaires that have more money then they could ever possibly spend turning a blind eye and ear to those around them that could use a helping hand. What is the point of accumulating billions if not to spend it on worthy causes?" Written by Richie-67-485852 on IMDb.com.<br />

"Kind of an odd combination of stars from the 1950s. "Powell" is David Wayne, probably best known for "How to Marry a Millionaire". Jim Backus -- Thurston Howell III, of course. Denver Pyle was the old guy on Dukes of Hazzard tv show...he's the narrator, and part time character. Keenan Wynn is "Wilkins", the bad apple in the group. Everyone trying to get rich quick, out west. and everyone out for themselves! some similarities to "Treasure of the Sierra Madre", where they illustrate how gold fever slowly makes one go mad with greed. It's pretty good. so much fighting. and scheming by both Powell (Wayne) and Wilkins (Wynn). Directed and produced by Josef Shaftel. and this was the second of just TWO films directed by him."
