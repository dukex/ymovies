<br />
Reviews:<br />
"There is no western hero more iconic that the Lone Ranger with his faithful sidekick Tonto. Furthermore, Clayton Moore as the Lone Ranger and Jay Silverheels as Tonto are firmly entrenched as the best ever in the roles. After years of playing them on television, two full-length Lone Ranger movies were made. This one is the second of the two. There is a wave of crime and terror taking place at the hands of a gang of hooded criminals that are ruthless. Several Native American men have been killed and there is uncertainty as to why. The local law is of no help to the Native Americans and tensions between the whites and Native Americans are growing. The Lone Ranger and Tonto ride into this situation and quickly become the primary force investigating the crimes. Prominent local citizens are the brains behind the crime spree, for the Native Americans are being killed for the medallions they wear around their necks. Each is a piece of a puzzle that when put together will be a map to a lost city of gold. The plot generally follows the formula for Lone Ranger adventures, modern viewers may object to the racial discrimination. For example, Tonto is beat up when he enters a saloon as there is a policy that no red men are allowed. Silver demonstrates a high level of intelligence in this movie, challenging Roy Rodgers' Trigger as the smartest horse in show business. As heroes go, the Lone Ranger was the ultimate in following the law and always doing good without asking for anything in return. The crime is of course solved and as must be the case, the last line of dialog is "Hiyo Silver away!"" - written by cashbacher on IMDb.com<br />
<br />
"A fitting and bravura end to the team of Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels as the West's most exciting vigilante team (Zorro worked alone). From the initial concept, the coupling of a White Man and an Indian as faithful companions set the stage for a coming together of the races and respect for the Native American.<br />
<br />
This Lone Ranger movie takes it to the logical and presents a story here that is provocative and ahead of its time, especially for the impressionable youth market. This cannot be overstated. Our Heroes are just that. They have a quality that is remarkable, commendable, and a Mythos that will endure forever.<br />
<br />
This movie is a wonderful experience. A colorful, action filled, Western that has an elevated script, some penetrating violence, and characters that are believable, with a depth of behavior found only in the better Westerns of the time.<br />
<br />
This final outing retires the beloved duo and is quite an accomplishment from all involved. This can proudly be revisited by generations to come as the Lone Ranger rides again and can exemplify the "better Angels of our nature" for all ages." - written by LeonLouisRicci on IMDb.com<br />
