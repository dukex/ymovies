Reviews:
Warning: Spoilers
"Cunning ace gunslinger Django (a solid and engaging performance by Anthony Steffen) enlists the assistance of loud-mouthed thief Carranza (an equally sturdy and amusing portrayal by Stelio Candelli) after his wife is raped and killed by a band of vicious renegades. Carranza is the sole person who can identify said killers. Director Edoardo Mulargia, working from a compact script by Nino Stresa, relates the fun story at a snappy pace, stages the plentiful gunfights with rip-snorting verve, and tops everything off with nifty touches of goofy humor. Steffen and Candelli display a winning chemistry in the leads; they receive sound support from Chris Avram as the lethal Jeff, Donato Castellenata as the friendly Paco, and Riccardo Pizzuti as the dastardly Thompson. Luscious brunette stunner Esmeralda Baldi supplies some tasty eye candy as the fetching Lola. The surprise ending is a pip. Marcello Maciocchi's dynamic cinematography injects lots of extra invigorating energy. Piero Umiliani's robust sweeping score hits the lively stirring spot. A cool little oater." Written by Woodyanders on IMDb.com.

"After his wife is murdered by a gang of cutthroats, Django (Anthony Steffen again) saves one of the gang's ex-associates from a hanging in order to identify the men responsible, finding them caught up in a gun smuggling scheme involving the Mexican revolution.

Although it steals ideas from about half a dozen other spaghetti westerns, this fake Django sequel is certainly fast-paced enough, with adequate production values and enough action to fill up it's running time. However, the comic relief is sometimes too pervasive and not very funny either. Way too often, it kills the tension and takes away from Steffen's hard-edged character.

Speaking of Django, as a justice/vengeance seeker, he sure is morally dubious here, gunning down a lot of people not responsible for his wife's death, including some men attempting to hang a condemned criminal (What a hypocrite!) and Mexican soldiers that just happen to be around when he kills one of the men that is responsible!

The "surprise" ending is fun, though you can see it coming a mile away." Written by FightingWesterner on IMDb.com.

"This spaghetti western has a typical but well executed storyline. The relationship between the two main characters is reminiscent of Blondie and Tuco from "The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly." It also has pretty decent acting, an awesome music score from Piero Umiliani, and one of the coolest endings I have ever seen.

I probably would have rated it even higher if it was dubbed in English. I don't mind subtitles in other kinds of movies, but for some reason I prefer to watch westerns in English, even if the dubbing is bad.

Still, it's a really enjoyable flick, and I recommend it to all die-hard spaghetti western fans." Written by spider89119 on IMDb.com.
