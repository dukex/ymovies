Storyline:
Andrea Balestri has dubbed himself Kid Terror O’Hara, leader of a group of children who head to the ghost town of Torque to play cowboy games.
One day, he overhears a gang of outlaws planning a bank robbery in River City, his hometown. As a game, and as part of an attempt to be taken more seriously by the adults in town, Kid Terror O’Hara decides he and his friends will rob the bank themselves.
In a complex plan that includes diversions, padded wagon wheels, explosives made from gunpowder and butter, and smuggling the smallest child into the bank in a piece of luggage, the children succeed.
They hadn’t counted on the outlaws looking for revenge once they realize someone got to the gold before they did.
Nor had Kid Terror and his friends quite figured out how they would tell the town sheriff what really happened at the bank. 

Reviews:
"Give this film a chance, and you might be pleasantly surprised. I went into it with empty gun expectations and wound up laughing more than at the far majority of the Spaghetti West comedies.

Some of the humor is crude. Offering the outlaws warm beer, Kid Terror has the child with the weakest bladder slip behind the bar and pee in two mugs.

But there are some genuinely clever moments — and dialogue — too. These kids have more moxie and ingenuity than they know what to do with.

There’s also a subplot with lots of familiar faces. A corrupt businessman named Wilson (Franco Ressell) is trying to squeeze farms off their land by not extending a loan to their leader, McKenzie (Attilio Dottesio).

Fortunato Arena plays the sheriff trying to sort through all the trouble in town." Written by Mark Franklin on onceuponatimeinawestern.com
