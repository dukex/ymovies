Story:<br />
Richard Harrison is Steve McGowan, who returns home after the Civil War to find that his father has been recently gunned down by henchmen under the direction of a land-hungry tycoon named Miller, boss of the nearby town of Tombstone. Caught trying to get revenge, McGowan is tossed in jail, where he’s reunited with the bandit Leon Pompero (Fernando Sancho). As he returned West, McGowan’s stage was held up by Pompero and his men.<br />
The two escape together, then form an alliance to bring down Miller. That mission is made both easier and more complicated when a stagecoach they steal turns out to contain Helen Kendall, Miller’s fiancée.<br />
She’s not exactly a willing or cooperative companion — well, at least not at first.<br />
Meanwhile, Miller sends for a hired gun — the dressed-all-in-black Sabata (Raf Baldassarre), who shows up with his own set of gunmen.<br />
Turns out Helen was just marrying Miller to save her family’s ranch. And when she learns what kind of man he really is, she decides to help McGowan and Pompero instead.<br />

Review:<br />
Lively, One Of Richard Harrison's Better Spaghetti Westerns<br />
Ex-Confederate Richard Harrison returns home from the war to find his father murdered by a ruthless land baron. Caught in the act of exacting revenge, he escapes with bandito Fernando Sancho and become hunted men, squaring off against the famous bounty hunter Sabata.<br />
<br />
With the nearly non-stop exaggerated movements of it's characters, the rapid-fire dubbing and comedic elements, this bogus sequel to Sabata seems almost like a comic book come to life or a live-action cartoon. It's all pretty broad, though fun to watch, the humor being a bit easier to take than a lot of other Italian westerns. It was better than expected and quite satisfying in the revenge department.<br />
<br />
Harrison and Sancho, who can seemingly play these type of characters in his sleep, make a good team. Written by FightingWesterner on imdb.com<br />
