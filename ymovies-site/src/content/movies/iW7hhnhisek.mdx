Story:<br />
Two men dressed as Cisco and Pancho have been committing murder and robberies. With a reward now posted the real Cisco and Pancho are captured. But the outlaws have one big final job to do and need Cisco and Pancho as alibis. So they break them out of jail and make them prisoners. This gives Cisco and Pancho a chance to escape and clear themselves by bringing in the imposters.<br />
<br />
Review:<br />
In this final Cisco Kid feature film before Duncan Renaldo and Leo Carrillo decided to concentrate on television, Cisco and Pancho are building up quite a reputation for themselves. The problem is that it's not them doing the crimes in and around San Lorenzo. It's a pair of fakers looking to draw attention away from themselves. In fact the boss has a very good reason for not wanting to draw any attention.<br />
<br />
This is a fast paced western. Leo Carrillo was not the dunce you saw on television, in fact shows some smarts when the guys are captured temporarily. Renaldo is not quite the skirt chaser as previous Ciscos were.<br />
<br />
Cisco remains a favorite cowboy hero of mine. Written by bkoganbing on imdb.com<br />
