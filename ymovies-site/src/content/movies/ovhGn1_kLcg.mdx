Storyline:<br />
Luke Barrett regains his consciousness and finds himself laying in the desert dust next to a dead man. Also, next to him is a rifle with the word 'Dingus' carved on its stock. Luke cannot remember anything that happened, who he is or how he got there. A bullet grazed his head and gave him a concussion. He has temporary amnesia. Nevertheless, he collects a few useful things from the scene of the shooting, picks up a horse and heads toward the nearest town. In town he goes to the saloon for a drink to help clear his head. In the saloon, a stranger clad in black greets him by his name and asks him why he's late. He also asks where Donovan is. Luke decides to play along in order to find out more about himself. Through conversations with the stranger and other townsfolk who seem to know a lot about him, Luke starts piecing together the facts. That's how he finds out that he, Luke Barrett, and partner Donovan were hired by the stranger clad in black clothing to kill Victor Barrett, a land-owner businessman who also happens to be Luke's brother. The stranger muses that Luke must really hate his brother to agree to kill him for a fee. Luke and the stranger go to a meeting place outside the town where Victor is holding a vote among the farmers who must decide whether to sell their lands to Victor, sell to the bank or not sell at all. While Luke decides to face his brother Victor for a gunfight, the stranger takes aim, using a sniper rifle, from a nearby hill. However, fate will throw things upside-down for both Luke and Victor Barrett. And, gradually, Luke will start recovering his memory which will prove to be both a good thing and a bad one.<br />

Reviews:<br />
"This spaghetti western was better than I was expecting it to be. It has a very engaging storyline. The protagonist has lost his memory due to a gunshot wound to the head, and he has to unravel the mystery of who murdered his wife and destroyed his family. The movie is very well played out, with suspense building gradually to a showdown at the end.<br />
The acting from all of the players in this film is very good, and definitely above average for the genre. Klaus Kinski is, of course, the standout in this category. He is always great to watch, and this is one of his finest eurowestern performances.<br />
The music score is rather minimalist, but well-suited to the film. The small bursts of guitar, and the organ part really add to the mood and tension of the movie.<br />
This is one of those rather dark and brutal portrayals of the west served up spaghetti style. There is not a shred of comedy in this movie, and that turns out to be a good thing here." Written by spider89119 on IMDb.com<br />
