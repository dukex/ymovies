Story:
Turning up after having found out a few days ago that the towns bank has been robbed, glasses wearing bounty hunter Stan Ross enters the a near by saloon, and quickly shows the tough locals that even if they are able to take his sight away from him, he still has enough cunning in his fighting skills to knock them all to the ground.
Impressed by Stan's no nonsense approach, mayor and bank manager of the town (who also has total control over what goes on in the town) Jefferson accepts Ross's request for money if he is able to capture one of the Mexican bandits from the recent robbery, dead or alive.
Careful give a silent and stern exterior appearance instead of a trigger happy one, Ross finds the Mexican bandits hiding in the mountain, and quickly ends up coming face to face with bandit leader Espartero.
Allowing Espartero to give the shocking news that he and his gang had no connection at all to the robbery, and also that Espartero had been recently working closely with Jefferson, Stan begins to wonder if Jefferson has a much stronger grip on the city than he had ever expected.

Review:
Worth Watching when You're Going through the Genre One After the Other
Whether you think this movie was atypical or not, I think, comes down to what you pay attention to. If you're the kind that gets into personal details, you'll likely think that, but if you're looking at the genre top down it's not that different than the standard fare. I felt it was a solid example of the genre and worth watching for genre-philes. It does well with non SW lovers as well, so, a solid entry I say. You could argue that it is very typical in the way it is atypical. The glasses are a good example. Seems an odd touch if you think of it in an absolute sense, but typical "routinely does the highly improbable" in SW terms.
I liked it. Written by adrianswingler on imdb.com
