<br />
Storyline:<br />
Glenn Saxon is El Desperado, a masked avenger who rights wrongs done to Mexicans by bandits and by the rich elitists in southern California.<br />
<br />
His real name is Manuel Lopez, and he also has his own score to settle. When he was young, bandits attacked his parents’ hacienda. He was the lone survivor. Now he’s vowed to get even with the five men responsible.<br />
<br />
One of those men is a notorious outlaw named Blackie Stark (Massimo Serato). In fact, he led the raid on the Lopez family.<br />
<br />
But the man behind that raid was Judge Wilkins (Beni Deus), who wound up making a fortune off the Lopez land.<br />
<br />
He’s now determined to make sure that fortune stays in the Wilkins family by having pretty daughter Evelyn (Barbara Loy) marry her cousin William, who’s every bit as racist against Mexicans as his father.<br />
<br />
It matters not that Evelyn despises William. It matters not that the judge’s wife Corrine intervenes on her daughter’s behalf. The judge has gained power, not he’s hellbent on preserving it.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Evelyn remembers happier days with a childhood friend named Manuel Lopez. And when a dress maker named Pedro Madero shows up, she has no idea he’s re-entered her life.<br />
<br />
It’s really El Desperado, of course, plotting his next move before warning those responsible for his parents’ death that he intends to see they pay for their crimes.<br />
<br />
And that’s enough to get the judge and Blackie Stark working together again. Written by Mark Franklin on http://onceuponatimeinawestern.com<br />

Reviews:<br />
"Well done Spaghetti — far better than you’d expect for one featuring a masked avenger — with a deep cast, plenty of subplots and a rousing score courtesy of Francesco De Masi.<br />
<br />
That cast includes Luis Induni, a fair sheriff caught between the judge and El Desperado; Jose and Carmen Perera, friends of El Desperado who might pay a high price for that friendship; and Estella, a saloon owner who can’t help loving William though he’s promised to another woman and is prone to chase any other pretty skirt who shows up in town.<br />
<br />
Only El Desperado’s short stint as a dress maker with three models in tow strikes a false note. And if you’re looking for action and a high body count — well, you’re in luck." Written by Mark Franklin on http://onceuponatimeinawestern.com<br />
