User Review:
''Craig Hill plays Doctor Janus who performs the occasional operation on a victim of his favorite brand of whiskey. One of these days, he decides to try a little bank robbery. All the gold dollars fall quickly into the hands of Carrasco (Chris Huerta) and his bandits. Now Doctor Janus is a lazy, patient man - he doesn't immediately follow Carrasco, but waits until a chance for revenge comes along. It finally does in the shape of Deborah (Claudie Lange), and together with the son of a friend, an entertaining chase for the gold begins.'' Written by unbrokenmetal on IMDb.
