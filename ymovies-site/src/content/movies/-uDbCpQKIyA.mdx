Story:<br />
In the 1880s, the town of Boyce's old sheriff, Bill Dowdy, retires. A vote is held to elect a new sheriff. Bill Dowdy encourages his younger friend, Gregg Leech, to run for the office. Also running for the job is the town's lawyer, John W. Harmon. Gregg Leech is reluctant to become sheriff because he plans to marry his girlfriend, Karen Childress. Gregg believes the sheriff job and the family-man role don't go together but Karen assures him that he can be sheriff and husband. Gregg is hesitant about it, since his father and grandfather, both ex sheriffs, died in the line of duty. Nevertheless, pressured by the retiring sheriff to run for office, Gregg accepts and easily wins. However, getting elected is one thing and being skilled as sheriff is another thing. Some townsfolk, who voted for his opponent, still hold a grudge against Gregg because they believe Gregg isn't man enough or brave enough to act as sheriff. Gregg's moment of truth approaches and he soon has a chance to prove himself capable of being a skilled lawman when three desperadoes ride into town. The three strangers claim they're there to kill the new sheriff. They are hired killers who accepted a contract to eliminate Gregg. He now faces the peril alone and he must do what the citizens elected him to do - keep the peace and enforce the law in town. The paid killers, drinking in the local saloon, send word to Gregg to leave town by 8 pm or be gunned down. With no help from the townsfolk, Gregg must gather his courage and face the killers.<br />

Review:<br />
Thoughtfull Western-Drama<br />
There is a lot going on in this little low budget western drama, and there is absolutely NO WASTE OF TALENT! Lyon plays the sheriff, who's father and grandfather were both gunned down while wearing a badge. It seems that he has just taken over from Buchanan, who has let a lot slide during the 15 years he was wearing the badge.<br />
<br />
I think that many viewers, especially immature ones, will have a tough time with this tale...it deals with the fear of cowardice. All men and women experience it at some time, however it is not considered macho to talk about it, hence we have more movies with Cooper and Wayne portraying the fearless, card board cut-out protagonist, rather than real life characters.<br />
<br />
The scene where Windsor and Buchanan berate and grind Lyon into action is unforgettable.<br />
<br />
The movie could have benefited from a more rugged realistic conclusion, however after all these years, this one remains a minor classic. Written by tonic560 on imdb.com<br />
