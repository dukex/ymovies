Reviews:
"You! A cattle man born and raised consorting with a bunch of sheep herders! Where's your shame?"

A fine little western about rivalry, betrayal, violence, and a noble man with a massive brim riding in on a throbbing white horse to bring justice. There's a delightful horror-comedy sequence in the beginning, a super fun ghost sequence in the third act, and some curious anti-gun sentiment; The rest is all the standard western goodies. I had a great time!

It's got a frame job, a criminal named Trigger Gargan, the eternal rivalry between cow and sheep herdsmen, a hideout, inheritance troubles regarding a coveted ranch, shootouts, the old 'stepping on the business end of a rake and getting bonked' gag, an avenging ghost, a Texas Ranger, bumbling sidekicks, a bar fight, and faking your death to beat the law.

Plus one bonus star for the nice little theme song sung by our lead.
