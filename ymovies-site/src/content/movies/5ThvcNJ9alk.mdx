Storyline:
"Imprisoned for a murder he did not commit, John Brant escapes and ends up out west where, after giving the local lawmen the slip, he joins up with an outlaw gang. Brant finds out that 'Jones', one of the outlaws he has become friends with, committed the murder that Brant was sent up for, but has no knowledge that anyone was ever put in jail for his crime. Willing to forgive and forget, Brant doesn't realize that 'Jones' has not only fallen for the same pretty shopgirl Brant has, but begins to suspect that Brant is not truly an outlaw." Written by Doug Sederberg on IMDb.com 

Review:
"With Yakima Canutt and seasoned henchmen who know their craft, it's no wonder Sagebrush Trail has great stuntwork. The endless action starts as outlaw John Brant's (John Wayne) train pulls into the station and lawmen are waiting. A dramatic cat and mouse precedes Brant hopping a horse and fleeing into the countryside. He hooks up with the stalwart of TV westerns Lane Chandler who ties him into Canutt's cunning band of heavies. They become partners in crime but the tension is only beginning as they both fall in love with Nancy Shubert. Now who's the real killer being chased by Bob Burns and expert horseman Hal Taliaferro? John Wayne is in the middle of intense crossfire. So it's a perfect time to see flashes of his famous Duke persona. With a great cast and thrilling story line, Sagebrush Trail is an adventure that can't be missed" Written by frank4122 on IMDb.com 

"Convicted of a murder he did not commit, John Wayne escapes from prison, hops a freight train, and heads west to find the real killer, finding himself part of a gang of armed robbers. He then tries to thwart the gang from within and convince his new best friend to give up his outlaw ways.

A fun entry in Wayne's cannon of Lone Star vehicles, this has great location photography, stunts courtesy of co-star Yakima Canutt, and a rousing finish. They even managed to squeeze in a neat underwater sequence!

The abandoned mine that the gang uses as their secret hideout is the much filmed cave at Bronson Canyon. Right after I watched this, I switched the channel and immediately saw it in a brand new Subaru commercial!" Written by FightingWesterner on IMDb.com
