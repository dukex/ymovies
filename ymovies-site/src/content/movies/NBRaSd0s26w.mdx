Genre: Documentary<br />

Language: English<br />
Release Date: June 30, 2020 (United States)<br />
<br />
Synopsis:<br />
To uncover the truth of American Ranching Heritage and Culture through the eyes of North, Central and South American Cowboys. "Cowboy Without Borders" follows the story of Gaston Davis, a 6th generation Texan from a ranching background, as he explores ranches from Montana all the way down to Argentina, and everywhere in between. He works alongside American Cowboys from North America to Central and South America. Although the focus is on cattle operations in these countries, the heart of the story is discovered when the viewer recognizes that although thousands of miles apart and decades separated by advancement and technology, the heart of the American Cowboy remains the same, and they will forever serve their people on their respective frontiers.<br />
<br />
Reviews:<br />
"This is one of the best documentaries I have seen in a long time. Everything about it is beautiful, from the cinematography and the breathtaking scenery, but especially the people who are featured. These are real, salt of the earth people who work in an industry that, right now, is popular due to "Yellowstone" and its spin-offs. But these cowboys are the real deal and we see the rigorous work they deliver day in, day out, 365 days a year. Gaston Davis, a cowboy himself, takes us from ranches in Texas, Montana, Mexico, and finally Argentina to show us how cowboys everywhere share similar lifestyles and values. I really loved it, and I hope we see more shows like this from Gaston Davis."<br />
