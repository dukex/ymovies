Synopsis:
Reb soldiers Roy and Gabby return to Texas after the Civil War. The Union Colonel they find in command is a fair man but his subordinate Captain and his men are out to rob and cheat the Texans. After the Texans give up their guns the Captain has the Colonel murdered, so Roy must find a way to retrieve the confiscated guns.

Reviews:
"Roy Rogers' career as a leading man had been going for less than two years when he teamed with his soon-to-be friend and mentor George "Gabby" Hayes. The pairing was perfect. Roy summed up all that had come before him in the way of cowboy stars. Gabby would set the high mark for what a sidekick should be, mostly because of his superb abilities as an actor.

The story begins with Roy and Gabby serving in the Confederate army as they encounter a small group of Union troops under the leadership of Colonel Denbigh, played by Wade Boteler. Gabby and Colonel Denbigh exchange words before Gabby and Roy return to their own camp. Back at camp Gabby tells Roy about his inheritance of half a cattle ranch in Texas, and the two make plans for their new life as ranchers after the war. Upon arriving in Texas Gabby soon finds out that the person who owns the other half of his ranch is none other than the Union colonel with whom he had eluded during the war is his partner. The colonel also happens to have a beautiful daughter named Ellen, played by Mary Hart. As Gabby tangles with the colonel, Roy pursues Ellen.

The bad guys are Yankees! Or, at least they appear to be Yankees. Colonel Denbigh has been put in charge of restoring order during the era known as Reconstruction. Having been instructed that a detail of soldiers would arrive to help enforce laws and aid in tax collection, he does not suspect that the soldiers that arrive are all crooked men who were thrown out of the Army. As the outlaw gang operates under the guise of enforcing the law, Roy must find a way to help the ranchers that are being robbed and defeat the crooks. Of course he does it with great charm and lots of excitement.

Southward Ho is an excellent movie from the Roy Rogers series of western movies. The movie does not rely on too much singing and romance. Instead it moves along nicely with the plot getting thicker and the action getting better. This one is definitely a must-see!"
