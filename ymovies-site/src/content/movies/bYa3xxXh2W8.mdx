Reviews:
"I checked out this film because of its star, Ty Hardin, and its intriguing title, and whatever you can say about it, it isn't boring! The first half of the film is the comedic, episodic story of "Sacramento" Thompson, who seems to be constantly getting into problems from which his grown children must save him, and who is a jack-of-all-trades including prizefighter and preacher! The first half of the film is leisurely paced and even features a gospel song. Hardin, who has always had a roguish charm, is perfect for this role and he's decked out in a gray-tinted beard, flashing his winning smile. Then, about halfway through the film, an event I won't mention triggers a kidnapping/revenge plot that continues through the rest of the movie. Without a star of Ty Hardin's talent and charm, I don't know if I would have finished watching this film, but he manages to make it all worthwhile. Hardin made a number of interesting films in Europe in the late 60s and early 70s. This one certainly does not resemble any other spaghetti western I've seen, so for that reason...AND to see Hardin's entertaining performance...fans of the genre might want to seek out this film."
