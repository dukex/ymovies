Storyline:
The U.S. Army has a pair of problems on its hand, one threatening peace with Mexico, the other threatening the commanding officer’s chance of being promoted.

The former involves gun-running. Someone is stealing U.S. Army arms shipments and selling them to the revolutionaries south of the border.

The latter involves a jailbreak. Killer Kid (Anthony Steffen) — one of the West’s most notorious gunslingers — was locked up at the army post. Now he’s escaped.

The problems merge when Killer Kid stumbles upon an ambush and saves the life of a young revolutionary named Pablito.

Grateful, he agrees to take Killer Kid to meet El Santo, the man behind the revolution in that area, the man the regular Mexican army is trying desperately to find.

Killer Kid proves useful in preventing the slaughter of innocents by Mexican officer Ramirez and his men while they’re searching for El Santo.

But Vilar, another of the revolution’s leaders, wonders if the Gringo can be trusted.

His mistrust isn’t misguided. Killer Kid isn’t who he pretends to be. In fact, he has a mission that might be counter to what the revolutionaries would like.

But now he faces a dilemma: He’s grown to appreciate their plight. And he’s fallen for El Santo’s lovely niece Mercedes (Luisa Baretto). Written by Mark Franklin on http://onceuponatimeinawestern.com

Reviews:
"This revolution-focused Spaghetti can’t compare to “Bullet for a General” or “Tepepa,” but it’s done well enough to be worth a watch.

The final assault on the Mexican regular army camp is particularly well done. And you’re likely to remember the scene in which Killer Kid agrees to prove his identity by shooting a coin from his lover’s hand at 30 paces.

Director Leopoldo Savona also gives Steffen plenty of chances to demonstrate his roll-and-shoot and spin-and-shoot capabilities.

Meanwhile, Fernando Sancho has an interesting part that doesn’t quite work. First, he’s willing to steal a wagon load of guns for his own gain, then he’s questioning Killer Kid’s loyalty.

In between, he’s the revolutionary always balking, eager to attack while El Santo argues that patience is the wiser course of action. And he pines for a female revolutionary named Delores who can’t stand his touch." Written by Mark Franklin on http://onceuponatimeinawestern.com
