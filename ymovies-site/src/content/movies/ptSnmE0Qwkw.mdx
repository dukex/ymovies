Reviews:<br />
"Fans of Italian Western will know Gianni Garko (aka Gerry Hudson) as Western Hero Sartana in many of his later movies. The first scene with the wonderful Fernando Sancho will remind you on Sartana but this time Gianni Garko will be another main Character. In "Per 100,000 dollari ti ammazzo" he is Johnny Forest (in some alternate Version round the world Django) a man who was accused to have killed his father by his brother. After years in prison he became a bounty hunter and his brother an outlaw. Johnny Forest chases his brother. The background to the Cain/Abel story is set place during the civil war. There are several interesting scenes including brutality of war and melodramatic sequences. As there are some flashback scenes and some atmospheric scenes in a ghost town. These flashbacks are the highlights of this movie and important for the story of the main characters. Overall the music score is very good but in the flashback scenes a bit too overwhelming.<br />
<br />
If you are looking for Westerns from Italy with lesser Action but more Story and atmospheric scenes "100.000 dollari di ammazzo" should be for you." Written by lostinaction on IMDb.com<br />

"Nice Italian Western with sad atmosphere ,full of feeling ,wonderful musical score and special appearance by the great Fernando Sancho . This is a very entertaining SW from Giovanni Fago and the prolific western and horror screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi. ¨For one hundred thousand dollars per killing¨ deals with two brothers hate until death since one of them killed their father. [...] Johnny Forest, tries to carry out his mother's dying wish that he brings in his outlaw brother, Clint, alive. On the run from Jurago, a former pal he has betrayed , Clint accepts Johnny's help, and agrees to surrender . But his lover ( Claudie Lange))is kidnapped and Forest seeks vengeance .<br />
<br />
Acceptable twilight Spaghetti Western with interesting dialogue by the usual Ernesto Gastaldi, splendid cinematography by Federico Zanni and memorable musical score by Nora Orlandi. It's a typical Spaghetti Western in which blends the common scenarios, as invincible and tough antiheroes, difficult and fast showdowns with numerous deceases, impulsive and quick zooms, lots of action, musical score with Morricone influence ."
