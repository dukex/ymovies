Reviews:<br />
"I saw this one under the title HANDS UP DEAD MAN. It's an Italian/Spanish spaghetti western co-production directed by the excellent Leon Klimovsky, a Spanish director who really knew his stuff when it came to knocking out genre flicks. His best films were the horror films he made with the likes of Paul Naschy, but as with many Spanish directors of the 1960s and 1970s, he also turned his hand to whatever else came along, hence this western.<br />
<br />
Klimovsky's stylish direction is one of the best things about this production and he shoots the various action sequences with aplomb. His film features a youthful yet powerful turn from Peter Lee Lawrence as the survivor of a massacre swearing vengeance on the villains responsible. Plenty of action ensues, including some comedy scenes such as those with monks and the like. The violence comes thick and fast and there's rarely a slow moment, just sweat, dust, tears, and cold-blooded murder. Espartaco Santoni has a scene-stealing part as the helpful bounty hunter Dollar, Aldo Sambrell is the baddie, and Spanish beauty Helga Line (of HORROR EXPRESS) fame shows up too."

"This is the first Peter Lee Lawrence spaghetti western I've seen. I have more to see piled in front of my television set, and I hope they are a lot better than this one. It's not Lawrence's fault that this western fails so badly - he does what the direction and screenplay command, and the problems with the movie lie with those two creative forces. Although the movie starts as a revenge western, surprisingly the movie forgets about the revenge angle for the longest time. Lawrence's character seems mighty slow in getting his revenge. In fact, "slow" is the best word to describe most of this western. The movie feels very tired, directed with no passion or energy. Even the (few) action sequences lack a lot of punch. Unless you are collecting westerns that all contain the tired plot of an evil land baron snatching up land by illegal means, I'd advise you to skip this spaghetti western."
