Storyline:
Those who might write about this film without seeing it might also question why the government needed horses during WW II (if that is all they knew about it from a short synopsis read somewhere), but viewing it one can learn that Jim Fellows, is the head of a government experiment in wild horse reclamation for purposes other than war, and his efforts are hampered by Gus Jordan, manager of the swanky Lariat Lodge dude ranch, but actually the leader of a gang of rustlers who steal the horses as fast as the ranchers can round them up for the project. When the rustlers steal a herd from Alice Blake, her kid brother Bobbie, sets out to get help from his radio favorites, Roy Rogers, King of the Cowboys, and the Sons of the Pioneers, who are en route to Lariat Lodge to play a one-night stand. 
While riding down the road with Gabby Whittaker, who has given him a ride in his jalopy, Bobbie sees three men who he recognizes as rustlers and, when he tries to stop them, they begin beating him with whips. His life is saved by the timely arrival of Roy and the Sons of the Pioneers. On the way to take Bobbie back to his sister, who is at the Fellows Ranch, they run into the rustlers on a raid, and take Burt Wooster and Pete prisoners. Wooster, the foreman at the Fellows Ranch, is actually an accomplice working for Jordan. He insists that he is not a gang member and Roy, pretending to believe him, agrees to let him take Pete to Sheriff Brite. Unaware that Roy and the Sons are following, Wooster and Pete go straight to the Lariat Lodge, where Wooster, after announcing that he is quitting, soon learns that he should have gone to the Sheriff with Pete, because Jordan and Pete shoot him. He lives long enough to tell Roy that the signal for a rustler raid is the playing of a certain song over the Lodge's nightly radio program.

Reviews:
"This one is a treat for any Roy Roger's fan, there's action to keep the story moving along with thoughtfully placed songs including the title track "Ridin' Down the Canyon" and "Blue Prairie" from Roy and the Son's of the Pioneers. Comedic relief is furnished via Pat Brady and Gabby Hayes with a running gag where each is told the other one is deaf. It's as much what this movie doesn't have as what it does have. No lavish costumed musical sets with orchestras and no action stopping slapstick comedy. If you want to know why Gabby Hayes is considered the iconic western sidekick watch this movie. A lot of the credit has to go to the dialog and screenplay by Republic Studios veteran Albert DeMond and Norman Houston. The script seems like it could have been custom written for Gabby who is almost a second lead in this one giving Roy the opportunity to what he does best, just be Roy.

After watching "Ridin Down the Canyon" it's hard to figure out why Republic Studios decided to tamper with such a successful format. After this movie and for the next several years Roy's simple, straight-forward westerns ever increasingly became theatrical musicals that bore less and less resemblance to his earlier releases. This movie is a perfect example of if ain't broke don't fix it.
