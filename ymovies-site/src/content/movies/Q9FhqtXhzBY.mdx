Sent to ferret out the criminal masterminds behind a profitable counterfeiting operation near the Mexican/Arizona border, the government agent and excellent sharpshooter, John Wyatt, goes undercover. Posing as John Rogers, Wyatt joins Doc Carter's travelling medicine show to find the dangerous gang whose boss is stone-cold Curly Joe Gale. But, on the Mexican side of the border, Wyatt approaches the captain of the Rurales to see if they can arrest Gale; however, two Mexican policemen arrest John instead. Can John Wyatt clear his name in time to protect Doc and his beautiful daughter, Linda, and bring the ruthless counterfeiter to justice?

Reviews:
"I really liked this little film. It has to be one of the best of the early John Wayne b movies. The writing isn't to bad as Wayne is a lawman who joins a traveling medicine show to sniff out a suspected counterfeiter. He meets a really cute girl and its obvious that Wayne was enjoying himself a lot while making this movie. The actor that plays the "doctor" was a real hoot, a very fine job he did indeed. He reminded me a lot of Walter Houston. Very similar acting style. There are several nice touches with this film. In one scene a posse chases down the medicine show crew. What makes this unusual is the fact that the posse rode horses and the medicine show bunch were traveling by truck!!!! Course it was a pretty sorry excuse for a truck mind you! Another cool thing were the songs played by the medicine show performers. Pretty cool old tunes there. Course i had to laugh when Wayne was doing trick pistol shots like snuffing out candles that were inches from the girls head. I'm sure a real father would have gone for that, ha. Supposedly the "doctor" was her dad. 
Overall, this is a very fun old movie and i got a kick out of it. Oh yeah, there is also an exciting chase and shootout at the end between the bad guys and a Mexican posse. Pretty darn well staged i must say. Great movie, a classic old b western with da duke!!!! Much better than Randy Rides Alone or Star Packer which were also on the DVD."
