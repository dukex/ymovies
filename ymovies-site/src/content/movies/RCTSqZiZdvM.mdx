Reviews:
"Yes,this is a flawed film.Yes,it has moments which stretch the believability quotient quite a bit.And yes,even as the ONLY official sequel to Corbucci's groundbreaking original,it seems to have little to do with it's forefather.But this film has its good points.First off,it looks good...the colombian location (inexplicable perhaps)has a beautiful feel.Django has become (again,inexplicably out of character perhaps)a man with more of a conscience and more of a heart...hes a monk now!Yet it's not unbelievable that 20 years and a daughter could soften a guy.Django(not out of character) is still killing racists and protecting innocent women (as well as children this time around) The death symbolism is still pretty potent (this time he carries his machine gun around in a hearse) It has great action sequences and effectively ominous music.It's got great costumes..(those guys in the graveyard in the black sombreros and black ponchos sure knew how to dress!)It has "Genre Icons" Franco Nero and William Berger(Berger's part is WAY too short,but it was great to see him).Suspend your disbelief (of course I don't believe you can dig up a machine gun after it's been buried for 20 years and seconds after digging it up kill 5 gauchos with it. No rust either!)and enjoy it! ..." Written by anomj7t7 on Amazon.com

"George Benton : George Eastman returns from San Francisco University to his brother's Jonathan farm : Ty Hardin . George is nowadays a doctor and he finds again his girlfriend whom he wants to marry in spite of opposition his brother. Then a gang of desperado bandits attacks his family with fateful consequences , as George searches "vendetta at dawn" .

Acceptable Western about usual theme : a relentless vengeance , as it follows in the wake Leone style and proceeded in Spaghetti style . It is a moving and violent Pasta Western with habitual ingredients as an antihero searching revenge , extreme baddies wishing gold , money and sex , along with regular final confrontation . Charismatic acting for the whole casting . Stars the prolific George Eastman or Luigi Cantafiori who played a lot of Pasta Westerns and other genres , along with the American ex-beefcake Ty Hardin who perfomed as US Westerns as Italian.

The motion picture was professionally directed by Sergio Garrone under pseudonym Willy S Regan , though it has a number of flaws , shortfallls and gaps . Sergio wrote , produced and directed various Westerns , genre in in which he would not only excel but one where he would spent much of his rest of career . As Sergio went on to helm several Spaghettis that include the following ones : Three crosses for Death 1968 , Deguello 1966 , Hurricane over Mexico 1967 , No Room to die 1969 , Django if you want to live.. shoot and especially The Strangers Gundown with Anthony Steffen , in fact this picture influenced in High Plains Drifter by Clint Eastwood . Although Garrone also made other genres such as Terror : Lover of the monster 1974, The Hand that Feeds the Dead 1975, Giallo : The Last Harem, Killer's Gold , Nazi-exploitation : SS Experiment Love Camp 1976 , SS Camp 5 Women's Hell 1977 and other genres as Comedy and WIP Women in Prison."
