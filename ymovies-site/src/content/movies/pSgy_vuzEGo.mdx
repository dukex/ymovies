<br />
Reviews:<br />
"The only way someone could think this movie was not sensational is if their sense of humor was highly uncultivated or if they were just extremely immature. The asides make it clear this movie was made just for laughs. The characters names, the costumes, and the starring roles of such Hollywood heavyweights as James Caan, Stephanie Powers and Sammy Davis Jr. especially made this film hilarious on almost the same level as Blazing Saddles. My roommate and I pride ourselves in having a refined sense of taste and we enjoyed this film thoroughly. And we didn't even have to be intoxicated to laugh uproariously throughout the entire film. The last scene in which Stephanie powers remarks to James Caan that the only person he didn't kill was the camera man was the icing on the cake." Written by philjac2002 on IMDb.com <br />
<br />
"A drifter named Jud McGraw(Caan) learns to quickly hate the wealthy bully who runs a small ghost town. The movie begins when some L.A. screen writer is going out to the desert to get an idea for a film. He ends up going to a ghost town in the desert and gets extorted by an older couple to see the "ghost town". The older woman promises to return is movie if he isn't satisfied by the tale she is tell of the "ghost town". The majority of the rest of the film is her narrative.<br />
<br />
This drifter runs into a Native American woman with her own grudge against this wealthy bully. The pair end up declaring war upon this small town, and come up with ingenious and funny ways to get revenge on the town bully. You have to like the idea. Things were really settled by fist, and it wasn't as if Jud McGraw wasn't getting the dickens beaten out of himself while fighting an opponenent.<br />
<br />
There is a funny role by Sammy Davis, Jr. as a fearless gunfighter. The gun really was power back then. The movie is rather violent and silly, but I do like the part about the L.A. screen writer looking for material in the desert. You really get an idea about life in the desert in this film. Towns spring up and disappear like they were never there." Written by jeremy3 on IMDb.com <br />
