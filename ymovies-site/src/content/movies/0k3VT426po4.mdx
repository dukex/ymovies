Storyline:
A banker named Stone is awaiting his son Clay’s return on the stage when a gold shipment arrives in Dallas.

But a gang of bandits ride into town at the same time. By the time the shooting ends, banker Stone is dead and the gold has been stolen.

Naturally, when Clay (Fred Beir) arrives in town finding those responsible becomes one of his main goals.

He suspects the gold robbery might be linked to the bandits who robbed the stage on which he was traveling, kidnapping saloon singer Kati Dior (Diana De Santis).

Clay manages to lock up Fast Draw Krenshaw (Luigi Ciavarra), the gang’s leader. He sentenced to hang.

Then the gang returns, with fliers that issue a warning. If Fast Draw hangs, Kati will return to Dallas. In pieces.

So Clay frees Fast Draw to rescue Katie, even though that’s going to put him in trouble with the law and threaten his budding romance with a former childhood friend named Estelle (Evi Marandi), who’s all grown up now. Written by Mark Franklin on onceuponatimeinawestern.com
