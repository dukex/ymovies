Spaghetti and Chorizo Western , co-produced between Spain and Italy and starred by two ordinary Spaghetti actors as the Italian Guglielmo Spoletini as William Bogart and the Spanish Eduardo Fajardo dealing with a real and violent confrontation . This is not an ordinary oater outing , it's a Spaghetti with Paella Western crammed with action , shootouts , lots of violence and a thought-provoking as well as sensitive story . The film follows the American Western models but also in Spaghetti style . An Italian-Spanish co-production with outdoor sequences filmed in Colmenar Viejo , La Pedriza and Manzanares Del Real , Madrid , and , Almeria , of course .

It's a medium budget film with usual actors , good technicians, passable production values and acceptable results . A better than average Western regarding a revenge story , with plenty of violence ,shoot'em up , thrills and noisy action.
