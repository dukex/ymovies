Storyline:
Tracy Powell, an Indiana farmer, gets the gold fever and heads for Stockton, California in 1849. There, he abandons his first partner, Bert Killian, and teams up with Sam Wilkins, a claim jumper employed by Willis Haver. Six years later, Powell returns to Indiana and his sweetheart, Julie. They marry and he tries farming again but, on the night their son is born, he takes off again searching for gold. This time he heads for the hills with an inveterate prospector, Jimmo McCann. A decade later, the two are still hunting for their big strike when McCann is killed in an accident. Powell returns home with news of a big strike but the deserted Julie will have nothing to do with him. His friend Killian will not believe him but Haver, now a banker gives him a small loan and then beats him out of his claim. Many years pass before he comes home, now sixty-years-old, and this time, his wife and son open their home to him. But he vows to go prospecting come next spring.

Reviews:
"Here is a nice little gem of a story that was out there all this time until I discovered it on TCM. Most excellent story-telling that uses 'gold" to capture and awaken the viewers emotions and wonder what it was like to mine for gold and start from scratch. There are many riches in the world and gold continues to have the allure especially when it was discovered and then mined for the first time. The idea of working hard to strike it rich is not far-fetched. People liked to work and wanted to work so why not work at finding gold? The thing is there were many working to take your hard work and claim it for themselves. Good movie to study human nature by. Greed! That's what does it to all! Here a man stays focused which is a good thing but then it turns into an obsession forsaking what is a true riches for the promise of earthly riches. The main character paid a steep price as did others to find out what the true riches are and were and will always be. This lesson goes on to this day and people still don't get it. It all stays here. Naked you come and naked you go so there must be a reason to be here. If it was just for gold etc., we would have known that deep reason by now. The movie brings the point home really nice. Some good moving scenes too. Reminds me of all the billionaires that have more money then they could ever possibly spend turning a blind eye and ear to those around them that could use a helping hand. What is the point of accumulating billions if not to spend it on worthy causes?" Written by Richie-67-485852 on IMDb.com.

"Kind of an odd combination of stars from the 1950s. "Powell" is David Wayne, probably best known for "How to Marry a Millionaire". Jim Backus -- Thurston Howell III, of course. Denver Pyle was the old guy on Dukes of Hazzard tv show...he's the narrator, and part time character. Keenan Wynn is "Wilkins", the bad apple in the group. Everyone trying to get rich quick, out west. and everyone out for themselves! some similarities to "Treasure of the Sierra Madre", where they illustrate how gold fever slowly makes one go mad with greed. It's pretty good. so much fighting. and scheming by both Powell (Wayne) and Wilkins (Wynn). Directed and produced by Josef Shaftel. and this was the second of just TWO films directed by him."
