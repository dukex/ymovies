Reviews:
"His Name was King (1971) This movie with a great title but lacked an overall deliverance to the audience. Richard Harrison and Klaus Kinski were very good acting wise even though the latter was only 5 minutes of acting, which I clocked it at.

Harrison who plays John "King" Marley who's brother was murdered and his wife Carol was beaten and raped. Of course King is looking on revenge and the culprits are the Benson Gang who is secretly lead by King's friend Sheriff Foster(Kinski)who are running guns illegally. Well King wipes out the Benson gang and has a great showdown with ex-friend Sheriff Foster. The soundtrack in the movie was very weak shocking from the great Luis Bacalov. Soundtracks for Spaghetti Westerns are a key in sometimes saving face especially if the story is dull or the acting is bad. I do however recommend the movie for Kinski fans!"

"I'm a spaghetti western fanatic, enough so that even lesser efforts in the genre entertain me. However, with this particular spaghetti western I find it hard to generate much enthusiasm, so I can only imagine what a non-fanatic might think of this movie. It has a somewhat confusing plot, with characters doing things that often seem murky. Harrison's character is an unexceptional hero, and several times is off-screen for long periods of time. Kinski's character ends up being bizarre due to Kinski acting completely different from what his character says or does at the same time. That does give the movie some moments of (unintended) humor. The movie does have some good action sequences and has a good musical score, especially the title song, which is one of the best ever composed for a spaghetti western. But in the end, you'll forget most of the movie not long after watching it, so I would only recommend it if you are really into Euro westerns (and Klaus Kinski)." Written by Wizard-8 on IMDb.com
