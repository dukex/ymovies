A judge encounters a man (Frank Latimore) he once wronged after an Apache attack. The attack forces him, his fiancée and their fellow stagecoach passengers to take refuge at a rest stop. Written on on rottentomatoes.com <br />

Reviews:<br />
Directed by FEAST OF SATAN'S Jose Marie Elorietta before Spaghetti Westerns had become a bona-fide genre, FURY OF THE APACHES straddles the divide between Cowboy Movies and the Spaghetti approach by having the minimum story necessary to explain what is happening and let the action speak for itself. Even The Duke probably would have liked this nasty, violent, and immensely entertaining film that manages to NOT rip off FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, though mostly because it wasn't a hit yet when this was made.<br />
<br />
This film has what most of the "great" Spaghetti entries lack, which is a genuine human story. Frank Latimore, an actor I am otherwise unfamiliar with, was well chosen to play the wrongfully disgraced former Army officer, now paroled and working the station with all of the cynicism of Bogie. And by Jove if fate hasn't sent the crooked judge who arranged for his misfortune into his very arms, complete with a fortune in hard cash and a pretty young wife to be (Liz Moreno, who is so gorgeous it almost makes you want to cry) who, it turns out, hates the bastard as well. Add a couple of ex-cons (one of them played by Spaghetti legend Aldo Sambrell, insane as always) who want to slit everyone's throats and make off with the goods, and THEN throw a thousand heavily armed Indian braves at them, and by golly you can kiss 90 minutes of your life good-bye. The film moves at a breakneck pace, complete with an ending that is oddly evocative of THE ROAD WARRIOR, which is probably the point, since George Miller doubtlessly grew up on the FORT APACHE type Cowboys Vs Indians thrillers that no doubt also inspired Elorietta & company.<br />
<br />
FURY OF THE APACHES is also interesting in that it is one of the few Euro Westerns (filmed in Spain by an Italian & Spanish crew) to directly involve Native Americans. One of the things that always struck me as odd about Spaghetti Westerns is how they seemed to forget that there were Natives here before the Gringos and the Pistoleros both, but other than a few comic relief moments and Sergio Corbucci's painful, anti-fun NAVAJO JOE, there really aren't too many examples of Native Americans playing a big role in Spaghetti fare. A lot of that has to do with the simple logistics of how the films were made: If you're shooting in Spain, you tend to use Spaniards as extras, and so we'd usually watch stories about Gringos encountering swarthy Mexican banditos and curvy cantina Senoritas. This time, it's just good old Cowboys & Indians, though it is too bad that all we see of the Apaches are the kind of pop up target bad guys that the Bugs played in STARSHIP TROOPERS. And yes, I bet Paul Verhoeven saw this movie also at some point.<br />
<br />
Another excellent example too of how the great Eurohorror directors all plied their wares in the other genres before making their Gothic Classics; Jose Elorietta may be better known for his horror shockers, but this is easily my favorite of his films and I love Gothic Eurohorror. Not to be missed!!<br />
