Jesse W. Haywood graduates from dental school in Philadelphia in 1870 and goes west "to fight oral ignorance." Meanwhile stagecoach robber Penelope "Bad Penny" Cushing is offered a pardon if she will track down a ring of gun smugglers.

Reviews:<br />
"The Shakiest Gun in the West This movie is so funny and many scenes are hysterical. Jesse W. Heywood/Don Knott's was studying to be a dentist. He has a female patient Mrs Stevenson/Katherine Barrett that won't open her mouth and he finally gets her mouth pried open puts in his finger and she bites it. His dental supervisor grabs her faces to show Jesses how to open her mouth and she kicks him. The expressions of Mrs Stevenson not opening her mouth is so funny. Jesse ends up fist fighting with her and they bat each other around. She fights like a man and almost wins til they end up on the ground and she is knocked out with her mouth open and Jesse works on her teeth. Jesse Heywood ends up graduating from dental school as a dentist. He wants to head west to do his dentistry. There are so many parts in this movie that are so funny. A few parts I did not like where the women's dress are too revealing. There are so many funny scenes. Dentist Heywood thinks he is a sharp shooter cause he shot a lot of Indians. His facial expressions of fears, pride and getting drunk are unbelievable. Watch it if you can" Written by ctyankee1 on IMDb.com<br />

"I see I'm in the minority here but the Don Knotts movie had a better cast and was so much funnier. Barbara Rhoades was more believable as the criminal and also more appealing than Jane Russell and Bob Hope is not as crazy funny as Knotts. We laughed a lot for Shakiest Gun in the West. We're 30 minutes into The Paleface and haven't laughed at all." Written by janmanuel2 on IMDb.com<br />
