<br />
Reviews:<br />
"If Gene Autry and Smiley Burnette's musical talents weren't enough throw in The Cabin Kids and Maple City Four with on sceen lyrics for audience participation. Judith Allen kept the tension just right in the love hate relationship with Autry and Weldon Heyburn played it well as the colluding oil foreman with a plethora of dirty tricks up his sleeve. Great music, action and a lot of fun in this early Gene Autry classic"<br />
