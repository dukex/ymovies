Storyline:

Rhiannon is deputized by the judge at the recommendation of the doctor and becomes torn between his new life and the prospect of robbing the next gold shipment.

Reviews:
"Wildly surprised at how wonderful this movie is. A stagecoach robber with incentives to change contrasted with a cave full of gold and a motive for vengence. Who wouldn't want to change for the most beautiful western lady ever, Ella Raines. Walter Brennan is not going down without a fight as the doctor and preacher who has a lot invested in Monroe. An injured Ward Bond is relentless as the sheriff who is caught in the crosshairs between Jeff Corey as the villain and freindly fire from his own people. Also good to see George Chandler of Lassie fame and Mickey Mouse Club's own Jimmie Dodd. I highly recomment Singing Guns with a great cast with a most wonderful story."

"If you like good old fashioned westerns, you'll like this movie. It is a common story of guy goes bad for good reasons and how he gets back on the right side. Look at the credits for Director, Writer, Screenplay and the list of actors.Can't get much better. That whole list is in the "A" category. Even with Vaughn Monroe's lack of acting experience it is hard not to like him because of the good story line and the "hero" that he plays, a goodguy that is good at whatever he does and only does it when he has to. He is the type of guy that anyone would like to be like. He can fight, shoot, sing, play the piano and ends up with the good looking Ella Raines. What more could a guy ask for. Good Entertainment!"

"In the early fifties, I was about 10 years old and my father forbid me to read comic books. Only books would do, he told me and one of the first books I came up with was Singing Guns by Max Brand, in a Brazilian translation named Armas Fumegantes with a great cover design. In the flap, I guess, it was mentioned that a film was made about the book with Vaughn Monroe. Who the heck was Vaughn Monroe? It took me more than fifty years to see the film and I sure enjoyed it. Monroe is very well cast as Rhiannon a man who has more than one million hiding in his cavern, which he took from the mine company. Ella Raynes is the beautiful Nan, the woman he falls in love with, Ward Bond is the sheriff, and Walter Brennan the good doctor who will try to reform him. Monroe sings three well chosen songs, one of them just before a showdown with the bad guy. The film was made in Trucolor, which is not much better than colorized, but it was one step better than the usual B western. The story is very good and the actors also, but the shootouts could have been better, and the bad guy less of a caricature." Written by tmwest on IMDb.com.
