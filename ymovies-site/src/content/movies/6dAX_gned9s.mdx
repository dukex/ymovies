Story:
A gang of gunrunners is sought by both the Mexican Rurales and the Yaqui Indians for different reasons - by the federal police to prevent the marauding tribes from preying on innocent farmers and by the Indians because the gunrunners' leader sold them bad medicine resulting in blindness for many of their children. The police capture the criminals, but both parties are surrounded in a ruined mission by the angry Indians. Can the cops and crooks work together to survive the onslaught of the tribesmen?

Review:
I really liked this tough little time capsule film. Wild story, of nasty double crossing bad people making trouble for themselves. The lack of big stars kinda makes it work. Martha Roth is really the rotten glue that holds it all together! The underacting by the rest make it all strangely more plausible. The strongest part of this film for mine is the excellent music score of Gonzalo Curiel which is a masterpiece of Western movie music! Solid theme, relevant and supporting incidental music is spot on with dynamic use of horns and flutes. Restating the theme with a blue vocal rendition of the tune round the campfire and a fantastic crescendo! The south of the border locations with the interesting landscape and climate evident, the extras, the props and costumes in this film are all excellent and deliver authenticity! The old Mex charro saddles with the pineapple horn!..
The color print, the sound and especially good is the jingle jangle of the federals spurs. Notice the detail of the guard on duty with his spurs on over the top of his feet to stop the noise......now that's western! The cavvy of horses in this film are worth a mention. I reckon that those tough little ponies are what horses probably looked like back in the old west. Very different to those grain fed quarter horses in Hollywood!
A strange Western Noir gem! Written by jdcowtown on imdb.com
