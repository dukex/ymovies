Synopsis:<br />
After his family is murdered in the 1880s, orphan Jeb Rand (Robert Mitchum) is raised by the Callum family on their nearby horse ranch. He remains haunted by this childhood trauma in a recurring nightmare of flashing spurs and confinement inside a trap door as his family is slaughtered. Widow Callum (Dame Judith Anderson) does her best to make Jeb feel loved as he is growing up, but the young man stubbornly maintains a sense of his own identity. While he has great affection for his foster-sister Thor (Teresa Wright), his relationship with her brother Adam (John Rodney) is tenuous at best, especially when Jeb blames him for shooting a colt that he was riding. Although Mrs. Callum blames the incident on deer hunters, she is aware that the it was actually the attempted murder of the youngster by her brother-in-law Grant (Dean Jagger), a shadowy figure who, for vague reasons, is determined to harm Jeb. Jeb loses a coin flip with Adam, and becomes the designated family volunteer to fight in the Spanish-American War. Jeb returns a hero, but does not find happiness. Although Thor loves him, Adam is resentful about sharing the farm's profits, and the omnipresent, enigmatic Grant remains at the fringes of Jeb's life, waiting for a chance to revenge himself on the young man in some mysterious vendetta as Jeb continues trying to exorcise his demons.<br />

Reviews:<br />
"Do the sins of the parents fall upon the children? That's just one of the questions this brilliant film noir with a western setting asks as the brooding Robert Mitchum recounts his story to his foster sister while waiting for his enemies to attack.<br />
<br />
Only a western because of its early 1900's New Mexico setting, "Pursued" is a brilliant example of how writers could cross film genres to make a powerful statement. Like 1950's "The Furies" (which ironically featured the always brilliant Judith Anderson), "Pursued" is an almost Greek tragedy like drama in its view of a family in turmoil. Mitchum doesn't need to speak much to express his lost soul; It is written in his eyes. Wright becomes almost like "Hamlet's" Ophelia as her hatred descends into a seeming madness in her quest for revenge. Anderson, then starring as the vengeful "Medea" on Broadway, utilized every trick in her brilliant acting brain to make this character both lovable and even somewhat sinister. This is no Mrs. Danvers ("Rebecca") or Big Mama ("Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"), and everything she does will keep you riveted, as she always did on screen, even in the most turgid of movies. It makes me wonder how she would have been as the mother in "Mourning Becomes Electra".<br />
<br />
While there is one outdoor shot that is obviously a backdrop, everything else technically about this movie is superior. It is a film that seems better with age, and is a must see for fans of the film noir genre as well as those who think that westerns are nothing but cowboys and Indians."<br />
