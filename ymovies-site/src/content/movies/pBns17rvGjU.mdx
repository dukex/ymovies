Synopsis:<br />
Ace Beldon is in prison, but with his stolen bonds not recovered, Capt. Saunders has an idea. He sends Graham to prison and has him and Beldon break out. With Ranger Raymond assisting, they make their escape and get to the hangout run by Stone. But the plan starts to go awry when Sam overhears Graham talking with the Captain and reports back to Stone.<br />
<br />
Reviews:<br />
"Even though Kermit Maynard never achieved the fame of his older brother Ken, his independent Westerns were always of a consistently high quality. Divided up between wild west actioners and Canadian Mountie adventures they all had a certain polish, including camera tricks and some interesting leading ladies who used them as a stepping stone (Ann Sheridan etc). Kermit was their best asset, a very breezy and athletic westerner who always kept himself in tip top condition, he was more a natural actor than his brother even though he didn't approach his popularity.<br />
<br />
After a dexterous display of horse riding, Texas Ranger Larry Graham (Maynard) has to get down to the business of finding out where "Ace" Beldon has hidden a bag of stolen loot before being sent to prison. He goes undercover to the State prison where as "Ace's" cell mate he attempts to win his confidence. He organises a jail break and takes Ace with him where they escape to Ace's hideout and of course Ace's gang don't take too kindly to Larry. He makes it very easy for them to discover his identity by trying to sneak off to the local Texas Ranger's headquarters!!! There is plenty of riding action especially at the end when Anita (Harlene Wood), eager to become the first female T.R., rides off with the money acting as a decoy so Larry can follow from behind and corner the crooks.<br />
<br />
Harlene (or Harley) Wood may have made her mark as a song writer but, for me, she will always be "Burma" the young girl lured into the world of drugs to become dope peddler "Blondie" in the campy, crazy "Marihuana" (1935)."<br />
