A Chinese immigrant named Chin How lands in a small Texas town inhabited by hard-nosed cowboys who don't take kindly to outsiders.

When word of Chin's skills spread to Stanley Spencer, the owner of the states largest cattle ranch, Chin lands a job working for Spencer as a fellow cowboy. Friend soon becomes foe when Chin realizes he is working for a cattle smuggler bent on brutalising Mexican farmers and anyone else who stands in his way. Written by Alan Smithee

Reviews:
"Immigrant Shanghai Joe (Chen Lee) moves from St. Francisco (sic) to Texas in 1882 in search of a life as a cowboy. Of course, he greets racism and adversity at every turn thanks to the local good ol' boys. Holy crap! I grabbed this film at random off a stack of DVDs and it was fun as hell. I'm not the biggest western fan (my filmdom shame) so I usually need an element to spice it up and throwing kung fu in there did the trick. This movie rarely slows down as Joe bounces from one battle to the next. The main crux has him on the run with a bounty on his head after he turns on a rancher using illegal immigrants. Top billed co- stars Gordon Mitchell and Klaus Kinski pop up as two bounty hunters and have about 5 minutes of screen time max. Director Mario Caiano gets the most out of the US locations (a widescreen copy is a must) and knows when to use slo-mo to great effect. He even throws in some surprisingly gory bits like a guy getting his eyeballs ripped out and a chest being punctured. Joe don't fool around! THE RETURN OF SHANGHAI JOE followed in 1975 with Kinski as a different character." Written by udar55 on IMDb.com
