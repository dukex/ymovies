<br />
Story:<br />
A group of bandits, led by the notorious Luke Morgan, steal an army stongbox of gold from a stage and retreat to their hideout with a kidnapped passenger as hostage. Carrancho, in turn steals it again, hides it in a grave and the chase is on.<br />
<br />
Review:<br />
Sizable role for the legendary Spaghetti Western character actor Fernando Sancho. More of a sympathetic character than his typical bandito role.<br />
Good music, but the voice selection for the English dub could have been better, especially for Rosalba Neri, who looks exceptionally beautiful here for a female in a western.<br />
One of the best westerns Rosie got cast in, although it was a lousy role for her, just a woman reacting to the actions of the men, kind of a waste of her abilities. Nice performances by George Martin and Daniel Martín.<br />
Worth a watch for fans of Fernando Sancho and Rosalba Neri completionists. Written by Jreg32 on letterboxd.com<br />
