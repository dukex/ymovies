Reviews:
"Cash-strapped drifters Anthony Steffen and Eduardo Fajardo save the life of a life of a trouble-prone Mexican ex-con with half of a treasure map tattooed across his back. Soon, the three find themselves partnered up with oily con-man Frank Wolff and a crooked sheriff in a game of double and triple-crosses.

Clearly inspired by The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly, this is straight-forward and colorful, with lots of twists and great performances by Steffen, Fajardo (who gets to be a good guy in this one), and villain Wolff, whose character seems to corrupt nearly every person he comes in contact with.

Well photographed, this makes full use of some excellent Spanish locations. It's always good to see Italian westerns with a lot of emphasis on outdoor action, with a good portion of the film taking place on the trail." Written by FightingWesterner on IMDb.com

"This movie has an original title that resumes almost everything about its story: Los Quatro Salvajes ( or The Four Ruthless Men). You'll see why. Two miserable adventurers (Steffen and Fajardo, in his best performance) help a Mexican guy to escape an attack of fierce 'bandoleros' just to find out that this Mexican outcast has a great secret: he knows - or, better, partially knows - where a great gold treasure is hidden. Why just 'partially'? Well, because he has just a part of the map to the treasure site tattooed in his back! Because of this he must find the other guy who has the rest of the map equally tattooed in the back; this guy is now a sheriff and so the hunt begins. An interesting story that resembles me a bit the Houston's classic 'Treasure of Sierra Madre' is charmingly developed by veteran director Mario Caiano although a bit far fetched and meaningless in some scenes and situations. Fajardo is terrific and Alejandra Nilo is a gorgeous face along the way. A spaghetti western that will delight the addicts of the genre and will be a good surprise to a new public as well."
