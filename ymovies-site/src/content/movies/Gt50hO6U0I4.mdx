Reviews:
"This a John Wayne film like no other. Take it from a huge fan that's seen most of his movies. Although this not classified as a comedy, the Duke's turns in a sly performance full of great one-liners and facial expressions that had me rolling. Its action adventure in the oil fields and it's very entertaining and fun. Wayne is Cowboy Dan Somers and he competes with oilman Jim Gardner for oil lease rights on Indian land in Oklahoma, as well as for the attentions of schoolteacher turned scandalous book author Cathy Allen. It has a good supporting cast including George "Gabby" Hayes. You will never see the Duke quite like this in any other role. If you're a fan of the Duke, you will love this film. It was originally titled "In Old Oklahoma" and then reissued as "War of the Wildcats"." Written by robjdelaney on IMDb.com 

"Duke has his hands full in this one. He wants the schoolmarm Martha Scott, fending off the rich Albert Dekker, and reluctantly in a battle for oil. Sidekick Gabby Hayes as Despirit Dean is in rare form throughout this classic gem. If that wasn't enough the showgirls had the greats Dale Evans and Rhonda Fleming. Prominent Broadway lead Marjorie Rambeau had some wonderful lines delivered to perfection. Grant Withers, Paul Fix, and Hollywood's meanest cowboy, Harry Woods rounded out a superb cast. Teddy Roosevelt and the Rough Riders would've been proud of this one." Written by frank4122 on IMDb.com
