Plot:<br />
Paul Hogan plays Lightning Jack Kane, a long-sighted Australian outlaw in the American west, with his horse, Mate. After the rest of his g*ng is killed in a robbery-gone-wrong, Jack survives only to read of the events in the newspaper that he was nothing next to others. Annoyed at not being recognised as an outlaw, Jack attempts a robbery by himself, and ends up taking young mute Ben Doyle (Cuba Gooding Jr.) as a hostage. He later discovers that, tired of never having been treated with respect due to his disability, Ben wishes to join him.<br />
<br />
Jack attempts to teach Ben how to fire a gun and rob banks, with his first attempt at "on-the-job" training ending with Ben shooting himself in the foot. Across the course of the training, they pay occasional visits to saloons where Jack shows Ben the truth about adult life, including helping him to lose his virginity. However, the true nature of the saloon visits is for Jack to make contact with showgirl Lana Castel (Beverly D'Angelo), who, unbeknownst to Jack, is madly in love with him.<br />
<br />
When Ben's training is complete, the two learn of a bank which is said the entire town armed and ready to protect it. Jack sees this as the test he has been waiting for, and together they hatch a plan to rob it. Everything seems to be going smoothly and they are set to begin, until Jack discovers that a rival g*ng of outlaws is also planning to rob the bank. He is prepared to give up when Ben has a plan of his own.<br />
<br />
Ben silently tips off the townspeople, who quickly swarm the bank with the rival outlaws inside. The g*ng are arrested and the entire town celebrates, allowing Jack and Ben to slip unnoticed into the bank and swiftly strip it clean. Before leaving, Jack jumps into the celebrations, ensuring that his grinning face is seen at the top of the town photo. By the time the true robbery is discovered, the two - and Lana - are gone, with a bounty of thousands on their heads and all of America searching for them - the life that Jack had always wanted.<br />

User Reviews (IMDb.com):<br />
<br />
"This is a comedy set in the old west. Even if it's not your favorite movie genre, it's worth watching if for no reason than the amazing acting by Cuba Gooding, Jr. It takes a talented actor to give such a strong performance without a single word of dialogue. Paul Hogan is as adorable as ever, although the role of Lightning Jack Kane doesn't differ much from his Crocodile Mick Dundee character. The supporting cast nicely fills out the roster of characters. I recommend this film for its light, entertaining value." Written by cheryl-142-917207<br />

"Beautiful work by Cuba Gooding, Jr. in this Western comedy with beloved Aussie hero (who also directs). All heart, but includes the necessary sweaty grimy sinister bad guys and violence. Lots of horses. (Great film to work for as a wrangler.) Also the gorgeous witty professional women. And Native American medicine. Good as a break from the daily grind." Written by abi_sheldon<br />
