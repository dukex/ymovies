Storyline:
The people around the town of Sloan Junction think that George Parradine is just a harmless book salesman, but he heads a gang of crooks planning to rob and pillage on a large scale. Their base of operations is the Reynolds ranch acquired by Parradine's front man, Leo Straykin, after killing the former owner. Needing money to finance their plan, they have rigged a scheme to cheat easterner Josh Taylor out of the $125,000 he is carrying to invest in the Reynolds ranch for a large group of people who want to settle there. To help check the titles and boundaries, Taylor has brought along a lawyer, Kenneth Jordan, and a surveyor, Johnny Bennett, who is really Jack Reynolds, the son of the former owner who is trying to find out who murdered his father. Circumstances permit undercover Marshal Rocky Lane to join the outlaw gang as a gunman, and with him is his sidekick, Nugget Clark, an itinerant patient medicine peddler. Rocky is working to uncover the identity of the head man, and his efforts are hampered when Jack Reynolds tries to kill Straykin from ambush.

Reviews:
"By sheer circumstance, marshal Rocky Allan Lane goes undercover when the outlaws mistake him as a hired hand they are waiting for. The outlaw headed by Roy Barcroft plans to illegal sell the ranch to Taylor. Another thrilling Allan Lane western, though it's a bit more slower with more emphasis on plot. The shootout finale is suitably climatic. The story can be confusing and the "unknown leader" angle could have been done better, but it's still an entertaining western."-Written by coltras35 on IMDb.com

"Rustlers On Horseback has a bit more plot to it than the usual B western from Republic. US Marshal Rocky Lane through a streak of good fortune has his prisoner killed by outlaws and then is mistaken for that prisoner. Which allows him to infiltrate the gang his prisoner was traveling to join for a bit of undercover work.

Good thing too because the outlaw gang that Roy Barcroft leads has quite a scheme in mind for a place that Barcroft murdered the owner to acquire. It makes a perfect hideout for an outlaw gang. But there is also Forrest Taylor who is bringing over a $100,000.00 to buy parcels of land for a new settlement. The idea is to steal his money and keep the ranch. And Barcroft is the muscle, there's a different guy who is doing the planning.

As these type westerns were meant for the Saturday matinée kid crowd usually the emphasis is on action. Action there is, but this one also has an interesting story line for us older kids as well."-Written by bkoganbing on IMDb.com
