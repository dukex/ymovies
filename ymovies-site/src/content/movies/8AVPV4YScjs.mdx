Storyline:
A wandering gunfighter joins the good side in a conflict between two rival rancher families.

Reviews:
"A mysterious wandering fiddler with a past (!) ends up killing a man in self defense, running afoul of a dangerous town big-shot, his sadistic son, and a slew of hired guns, including special guest killer Gordon Mitchell.

Not a bad little spaghetti western, Kill Or Be Killed has nothing new to offer the genre, but is solid enough and has an interesting storyline with plenty of action, nasty villains, and plot-twists to keep things entertaining.

Fans of Italian westerns will probably like this a little more than the average viewer though." Written by FightingWesterner on IMDb.com.
