Review:
Simple but effective Spaghetti
This Italo-Spanish movie has all the classic ingredients of a good spaghetti.
Just to set the scene, a bandit along with a bounty killer found themselves against powerful ranch owners, but will these two be able to bring a little law and order to Mile city, where violence and villainy are considered to be a virtue.
What an impressive camera work, especially in the opening scene, where you can see the bounty killer on the back of a donkey through the arched hands of the two competitors.
I rented the DVD of this movie from LASER(specialist DVD libraries in Dublin), my main criticism of the movie is that the lips are not harmonized with the words, but that shouldn't be a matter of concern as the roses have thorns too.
A good combination of Anthony Steffen and Frank Wolf, both icons of Spaghetti Western.
The score adapted for the movie is pleasant to hear. Note, the song "there will come a morning" by Carlo Savina.
it is movie I would recommend to a friend, and a foe for a change! Written by aheibe on imdb.com
