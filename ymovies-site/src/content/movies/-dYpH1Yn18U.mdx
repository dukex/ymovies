User Review:<br />
''Rugged fast-on-the-draw bounty hunter Django (smoothly played by Jeff Cameron) hunts down notorious bank-robbing outlaws the Cortez brothers. He's assisted by shrewd card sharp Fulton (an engaging performance by Gengher Gatti) and hale'n'hearty hombre Pickwick (robustly essayed with amiable scruffy charm by John Desmont), who just wants to get his saddle back (and beats people up with said saddle!). Meanwhile, several other folks plot to get their greedy hands on the stolen loot. Director Luigi Batzella, who also co-wrote the straightforward script with Mari De Rosa and Gaetano Dell 'Era, relates the fun story at a snappy pace, stages the shoot-outs and fisticuffs with considerable aplomb, and further spruces things up with a few amusing touches of goofy humor. Cameron and Desmont display a winning chemistry in the leads, Edilio Kim makes for a perfectly hissable villain as ruthless bandito g*ng leader Ramon, gorgeous brunette knockout Angela Portaluri supplies lots of sizzle as s*xy'n'scheming saloon gal Donna Dolores, and the fetching Esmeralda Barros likewise provides extra spark as the spunky Pillar. Giorgio Montagnani's crisp and lively cinematography injects an additional rip-snorting energy. Vasili Kojucharov's twangy score hits the rousing spot. Best of all, there are a few neat surprise twists at the very end. An enjoyable oater.'' Written by Woodyanders on IMDb.<br />
