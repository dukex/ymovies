<br />
Reviews:<br />
"One of the best of Monogram's Lone Star series - not only action-packed and fast-moving, but utilizing an interesting cast in a fairly involving script, all filmed on a fair-sized budget.<br />
<br />
John Wayne of course is the man who packs the star. In point of fact he wears two stars in his efforts to unmask The Shadow. There's a bit of mystery as to The Shadow's identity, though this soon becomes obvious. The seasoned fan will have no trouble, and even the casual picturegoer should tumble to it sooner rather than later. Nonetheless the actor concerned puts up a good show.<br />
<br />
It's pleasing to report that not only is Wayne in top form, but that his mate Yakima Canutt has a major role in this one as the Duke's constant sidekick - an Indian named Yak. In fact Canutt is one of the chief joys of the movie, performing an astonishing number of increasingly spectacular stunts, including several leaps from horse to horse, a wagon plunge, and five or six Flying W's including one which catapults two riders off the one horse. Bradbury directs the triple action climax with all stops out. Lots of running inserts add to the excitement as a fair-sized posse rounds ups a fair-sized gang of outlaws. Locations are reasonably picturesque. And we love those whip pans!<br />
<br />
The support cast, led by slim heroine Verna Hillie, also comes over as top-notch."<br />
