Storyline:
Sean Todd is Johnny Dark, a man who returns to town after a year working his gold mine and is immediately invited to join a crooked card game.

Ah, but this is a crooked card game with a twist. It’s rigged so that one stranger wins and one loses, prompting a showdown when the cheat is revealed.

Then the sheriff will place a bounty on the head of the card player who doesn’t die. That’s where quick gun Stack (Giovanni Cianfriglia) will step in to collect the bounty.

And since Johnny knows the location of a gold mine, the bounty on his head will be unusually large.

By the time the dust settles, Stack is wounded and determined to get even with Johnny. Johnny’s also wounded and rescued by the McGovern family.

That lands him smack dab in the middle of a land war. A townsman named Marlow is scooping up land for the railroad. Old man McGovern is one of the most determined holdouts. And the railroad has just given Marlow a tight new deadline for securing all the land it needs.

That’s going to draw Johnny into a new dispute, because he feels quite at home on the McGovern ranch. It reminds him of a happy childhood. And to say McGovern’s teenage daughter Sally is infatuated with the handsome stranger would be an understatement.

But what’s up with the well-dressed stranger named Donovan, who keeps showing up when Johnny needs him most? Written by Mark Franklin on http://onceuponatimeinawestern.com

Reviews:
"This is a serious Spaghetti loaded with action, but featuring a few comic touches and different enough to satisfy most fans of the genre.

For instance, in Spaghetti land, bad guys can often be dropped by a single bullet from a mile away. In Stack, we have a twice-wounded villain who still keeps coming back for more.

And how many Spaghett Westerns give a prominent role to a teenage girl who’s smitten with the hero? So smitten in this case that she cuts off a lock of his hair in the middle of the night.

Johnny, meanwhile, winds up waging a three-sided war, trailed by Stack and his allies, trying to defend the McGoverns from Marlow and his men and winding up squaring off against Mexican bandit Alvarez too since he handles some of the gunplay for the land grabbers."
