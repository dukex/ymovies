Story:<br />
Red Ryder gets a telegram from his old friend Dan O'Connor asking for help in his fight against Faro Savage and his gang of rustlers. A gun dropped by Faro during a rustling raid makes Red and Sheila O'Connor, Dan's daughter, think they have ample proof against Faro but they are stymied by the law. Buckskin Blodgett and the Duchess, Red's aunt, find the body of O'Connor who was killed when Faro's men sent the sheriff out on a ruse. Sheila, discovered while rifling Faro's office for evidence, escapes but not before she is recognized. Faro kills one of his own henchmen and then frames Sheila for the murder. Red and Little Beaver set out to clear Sheila and to try to find evidence against Faro and his gang.<br />

Review:<br />
The Fighting Redhead<br />
Red Ryder, Buckskin, the Duchess and Little Beaver go to the help of an old rancher who has been threatened by the gang of a crooked saloon keeper. They run into his revenge-seeking daughter who's quick on the draw.<br />
<br />
Comparisons to the previous Red Ryders featuring Wild Bill Elliott and Rocky Allan Lane are inevitable and I do love those films but the Fighting Redhead featuring Jim Bannon isn't too bad - it still has the enjoyable elements of the Republic Red Ryders such as the villainous schemes, the engaging plot and Jim Bannon makes a decent Red Ryder, even though he isn't as good as the aforementioned actors. Still he has a natural charm. Written by coltras35 on imdb.com<br />
