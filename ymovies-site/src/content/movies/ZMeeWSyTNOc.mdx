Storyline: 
Jeff Cameron is Tom Carter and he’s a man on a mission to get revenge for his brother Jerry, who was gunned down after pulling his life savings out of the Rio Canyon town bank.

His search leads him to Green Waters, where he crosses paths with a traveling salesman who witnessed his brother’s death and says the man responsible was Ringo Brown.

He also crosses paths with a pretty saloon owner named Cora (Krista Nell). Tom Carter suspects she might have had something to do with the murder too.

Jerry was infatuated with Cora. So infatuated, he had pulled his savings out of the bank to help save her saloon from financial ruin.

Turns out, those who would gain if her saloon goes under include Shannon (Gianfranco Clerici) and his partner and fast gun Lee Rast (Donal O’Brien).

And they cook up what they think is the perfect ambush to do away with their new problem — have someone pretend to be Ringo Brown and challenge Carter to a showdown while their other henchmen fire away from hiding places to help finish him off.

After all, Rast is busy with his other dirty deeds of the moment, trying to steal a map to Jack “Mule” Buchanan’s gold mine and trying to cheat Mule’s daughter Julie and her husband Bill Joyce out of their ranch.

Reviews: 
"Give big kudos for efficiency and imagination to director Luigi Batzella. He managed to shoot one film and make two movies out of it.

Either that, or he magically reassembled the same cast and shot just a few new scenes for 1972’s “God is My Colt .45.”

Large chunks of this film wound up in that one, including entire shootouts. The climatic shootout in this film, for instance, winds up appearing in the middle of the later film.

Of the two, this one has a slightly more logical plot, a much larger role for pretty Kirsta Nell, and much less of villains Rast (O’Brien) and Shannon (Clerici).

But there are also plenty of unintentionally funny moments, including the catfight between Nell and saloon girl Zelda (Sofia Kammara).

Oh, and O’Brien plays a fast gun spooked by a old Indian fortune teller who recently told him he was merely a lucky shot when he outdrew the first 12 men he killed. " Written by Mark Franklin on on onceuponatimeinawestern.com
