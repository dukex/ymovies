Full Western Movie, Full Length Cowboy Film, English: Kentucky Rifle is a 1955 American Western movie starring a buckskin-clad Chill Wills and featuring Cathy Downs, Sterling Holloway and Henry Hull, involving smuggling a wagon filled with rifles past American Indian tribes already aware of the subterfuge. The picture was directed by Carl K. Hittleman.

In order to pass through Comanche territory, the stranded passengers of a West-bound wagon train must sell the Indians their rifles in this western from Carl Hittleman.

A man escorts a wagon load of Kentucky rifles through Indian territory and must find a way to get through without losing the rifles to the Indians. Unfortunately the Indians know about it, and give the occupants an ultimatum: either the rifles or their lives.
