Reviews: <br />
"This is a very funny Italian western! The characters are very amusing especially Tomas Milian who gives us a beautiful interpretation of a funny sort of bounty killer called "Provvidenza". This movie will make you laugh a lot without be vulgar or foregone. Least but not last the nice soundtrack by Ennio Morricone will remain stamped in your mind!"

""Death Rides A Horse" director Giulio Petroni's "Life Is Tough, Eh Providence?" is a slapstick Spaghetti western comedy that is nothing like his other westerns. Genre stalwart Tomas Milian plays a mustached bounty hunter named Providence. He wears his derby so low that it crimps his ears with comic results. He speaks with a weird nasal lisp and looks incredibly buffoonish in his suit and tie with gloves. He travels around in a modified Wells Fargo stagecoach. Paunchy American character actor Greg Palmer co-stars with Milian in his silly frontier saga. He plays a thick-headed outlaw called the Hurricane Kid. Six scenarists, including Franco Castellano, Günter Ebert, Antonino Marino, Giuseppe Moccia, Antoinette Pellevant , and Piero Regnoli, along with Petroni himself have fashioned a lowest common denominator comedy not unlike the "Trinity" movies. Palmer makes a perfect Bud Spencer type, while Milian hams it up as an umbrella-toting bounty hunter who wields a derringer with a deadly accurate aim. When they are playing everything for laughs, the filmmakers appropriate the plot from Leone's "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" as Providence brings Hurricane in for the reward money and then engineers Hurricane's subsequent escape so they can pull the same stunt again. "Life Is Tough, Eh Providence?" appears to have been lensed in Italy rather than Spain since we never see any of those distinctive Spanish mountains. In other words, most everything looks green. Tomas Milian is nothing like you've ever seen him in a Spaghetti western. Incredibly, this unprepossessing oater boasts a musical score performed by Ennio Morricone. There are some interesting gags, especially the game of pool. Difficult as it is to believe this farce actually spawned a sequel the following year entitled "Here We Go Again, Eh Providence?" Milian and Palmer both reprised their roles. Italian tough guy stunt man Giovanni Cianfriglia plays a card-sharp thug who is roundly trounced in that hilarious pool tournament with Providence. Mind you, only fans of the Marx Brothers will appreciate a gag about tw0-third of the way through the film that is a variation on a Frank Tashlin gag from "A Night in Casablanca." Harpo is leaning against a building when a French policeman asks him if he (Harpo) thinks that he is holding up the building. Harpo nods with an impish grin, steps away from the building and the edifice collapses. Hurricane is leaning against a tree when Providence asks him a similar question. Hurricane steps away from the tree and it keels over and hits the ground. Altogether, "Life Is Tough, Eh Providence?" shows not only Tomas Milian in a different light but also director Giulio Petroni in an entirely different light. " Written by zardoz-13 on IMDb.com<br />
