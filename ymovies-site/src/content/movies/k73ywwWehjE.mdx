They arrive in Tulare just in time to rescue Matt from being hanged, but a guard is killed during their escape. Ed Larkin (Rory Mallinson) who framed Matt, falsely accuses them of a long list of crimes. They return to Fort Grant so that Tom can see his sweetheart Laura Brook (Virginia Grey). They encounter outlaw Bill Devlin (William Haade) who persuades them to hold up a train which Laura unwittingly told them would carry a large payroll. Soon the whole territory is enraged at their deeds. They return to Fort Grant to hold up the two banks that are filled with huge sums of cattle money.<br />

Review:<br />
That's my favorite from director Sam Newfield who, with this film, proves he could give interesting movies when he wished to, and also when he had the adequate budget.... Sheriff turned outlaw, we'll have it nine years later with Alan Ladd in ONE FOOT IN HELL. Here Preston Foster is marvelous, gripping in this so ambivalent character, and I was glued to this outstanding little western that loooks like a Reginald Le Borg or Lesley Selander's film, or at worst, an Edward L Cahn's from the thirties...Do not miss the final shoot out, not that far from THE WILD BUNCH. If there is one Sam Newfield's film you must see, this is definitely this very one. Written by searchanddestroy-1 on imdb.com<br />
