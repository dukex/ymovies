Story:
A drifter comes to town where his brother is sheriff. His brother is actually a robber who broke the real sheriff's leg and left him for dead, and became sheriff in order to hide out. They team up against the local land baron who is trying to get rid of the Mormon settlers in a valley he wishes to own.

Reviews:
"By 1970, the spaghetti western genre was looking tired, until Enzo Barboni made this amiable romp. Terence Hill plays the 'Trinity' of the title, a blue-eyed gunslinger so laid back as to make 'The Man With No Name' look like The Milky Bar Kid. Teaming up with his brother 'Bambino', a bearded giant of a man portrayed by Bud Spencer, they come to the aid of a Mormon community under threat from a greedy landowner played by Farley Granger.

Hill and Spencer make a great double act. The film manages to be hilarious without being crude or offensive. Highlights include Trinity shooting a man dead without once turning round, some improvised surgery to remove a bullet ( using whisky as anaesthetic ) and, of course, the climax in which the normally passive Mormons engage in battle with the Major's men. Great music here! Unsurprisingly, the film broke box office records in Italy and led to a sequel 'Trinity Is Still My Name' which, alas, wasn't nearly as good."
