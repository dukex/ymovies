Reviews:<br />
Francis X. Bushman Jr. (Yes, his son!) and Rin Tin Tin Jr. (blood line questionable) star together in this somewhat implausible, but still entertaining barn-buster featuring an RCMP officer trying to find out who murdered a fur trapper, and why the fur trapper's daughter has embezzled from the company she works for! Happily, Rin Tin Tin is there to help sort out this mystery (Damn, that is one smart dog.. He knows who's the bad guy and the good guy AND which path the bad guys take to escape!). So this is all nonsense, not really to be taken seriously (including the atrocious Canadian accents and the RCMP mistakes!) but nevertheless good for an hour to kill.<br />
