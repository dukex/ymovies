<br />
Storyline:<br />
The Civil War has ended, but the fighting hasn’t out West. Bands of ex-Rebel soldiers are still terrorizing the countryside.<br />
<br />
Capt. Jeff Madison (Alan Steel) is on one of the best at bringing those renegades to justice.<br />
<br />
Now he’s on the trail of one of the most notorious, Machedo (William Berger).<br />
<br />
Machedo’s men set an ambush for Madison; only he and a sergeant survive. They return to Fort Mason, to find Machedo’s men have captured it as well.<br />
<br />
Madison flees, but is caught. Rather than putting him to death, Machedo has him staked out, fires two bullets into his gun hand, and then leaves him for dead.<br />
<br />
Only Madison doesn’t die. Though his gun hand is permanently crippled, he’s rescued by Indians, including a pretty maiden named Swanna.<br />
<br />
Two years later, when Machedo’s men steal a small fortune in gold coins from a bank, Madison returns.<br />
<br />
First, he hijacks the hearse being used to sneak the gold out of town. Then he hides the gold in a ghost town called Blackston Hill in order to lure Machedo and his gang there to dole out his revenge.<br />
<br />
But the odds will be long. Especially for a man who isn’t the gunman he once was. Written by Mark Franklin on http://onceuponatimeinawestern.com<br />

Reviews:<br />
"This movie was made in 1972, but seems more like it came from the mid to late 60's when spaghetti westerns generally had a more serious tone.<br />
<br />
It is a typical but very good revenge tale about an ex-union officer whose hand was crippled by an ex-confederate who leads a band of guerrillas who continue to terrorize people after the war is over. It's fun to watch as the now clad-in-black hero seems to come back from the dead, and hunts down and kills his enemies one by one.<br />
<br />
Sergio Ciani plays the protagonist in a performance that is horrible even by spaghetti western standards. In all fairness though, there may be another person dubbing his voice who can be blamed in whole or in part for the wooden performance. I don't know, but it's pretty bad. Fortunately, William Berger makes up for it. He is excellent in the role of Machedo, the leader of the confederate gang. This is definitely Berger's movie. It's probably the best performance I've seen from him.<br />
<br />
The music score by Ferrio is also very good.<br />
<br />
If you are into Euro-westerns, this ones worth checking out." Written by spider89119 on IMDb.com.<br />

Warning: Spoilers<br />
"FAST HAND IS STILL MY NAME is a suitably gritty spaghetti western starring a former peplum star in the title role. Said actor is none other than Alan Steel, here scrawnier and more aged, but still cutting a dash as a tortured soldier who is attacked and forced to witness a massacre perpetrated by a gang of cut-throats. The story subsequently follows a revenge narrative as Steel heads on a path of violent justice to bring those responsible to book. Mario Bianchi's story is sufficiently bloody and shocking to work; it's not one of the most memorable spaghetti westerns in existence, but it does the job ably enough. The excellent supporting cast includes genre regulars Frank Brana and William Berger as members of the aforementioned bandit gang" Written by Leofwine-Draca on IMDb.com.<br />
