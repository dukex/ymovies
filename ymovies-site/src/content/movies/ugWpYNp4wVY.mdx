Storyline:
Kit Banion, a Virginia-born beauty and product of post-Civil War chaos, has settled in Wyoming and prospered; acquiring a fortune and a hotel, which, like the owner bears the name of "The Maverick Queen."---a title picked up by Kit in her earlier days in Wyoming when she took every unbranded steer and put her own brand on it. Love and trouble enter her life in the person of a Pinkerton detective posing as Jeff Younger, nephew of the infamous Younger brothers. He is dedicated to catching Butch Cassidy and the members of The Wild Bunch.

Reviews:
"Stanwyck's portrayal of the outlaw woman Kit Banion is an all-time classic. This role sets the standard for strong western women in the cinema. Stanwyck perfect for the role of the beautiful and strong-willed Kit Banion, leader of the Wild Bunch outlaw gang who can ride and shoot with the best of them. Stanwyck more than holds her own, matching wits and pistol shots with outlaws and lawmen alike. However, her lawless days are numbered when she falls in love with a Pinkerton agent (Barry Sullivan) who infiltrates the gang. Good supporting cast with familiar supporting actors. Visually pleasing with great western scenery, shot on location in southrn Colorado. Exciting action scenes liven up a sometimes plodding script. Well worth watching. A must see for fans of classic westerns."-Written by chazz-7 on IMDb.com

"That's for me the best movie from director Jo Kane, this prolific director who never quit Republic Pictures. Of course ROAD TO DENVER was also a good western but this one, starring Barbara Stanwyck in a role very close to the ones she had in FORTY GUNS, THE FURIES and CATTLE QUEEN OF MONTANA, this western is helped by superb Colorado state settings, and a music score - and song - that brings you far beyond this tepid and so predictable story. Barbara Stanwyck is as good as ever and Scott Brady doesn't deceive either, nor Barry Sullivan. In France, it was released in VHS, in Naturama - 2.35 frame. We were so lucky. So were we with another Jo Kane' film: JUBILEE TRAIL. One more last thing, it is very amusing to see evoking Butch Cassidy, Younger brothers and several West legends who had nothing to do with each other in real life. But many westerns did the same."-Written by searchanddestroy-1 on IMDb.com
