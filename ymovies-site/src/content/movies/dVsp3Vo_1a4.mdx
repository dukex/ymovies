<br />
Reviews:<br />
This is one of my favourite Roy Rogers films...it's only 55 minutes, so the writing is tight and there aren't many distractions from the story (which is a problem in some later ones); the music is at its top; the acting is all quite good; there's even a stagecoach race!! And the story itself is quite amusing, which also became a problem in later films when they were being churned out a mile a minute and the quality severely deteriorated. It's just a shame the print I saw was really poor quality...it would have been even more enjoyable.<br />
<br />
I'm not the biggest Roy Rogers fan, I don't like the genre much, although I find his films more amusing than most others (and I near-*despise* Gene Autry...), but sometimes he's on, and he is here. His screen-presence is really high here, and he plays off of the other characters quite well.<br />
<br />
Overall: This is definitely better than most of the others I've seen; I should probably hunt down some more of the earlier ones...I'd definitely recommend this to any Rogers fan! 8/10.<br />
