Synopsis:
Insurance Investigator Roy is looking for Weston and the missing money he supposedly obtained in a robbery. When he catches him and listens to his story, he changes his mind about him. A freak accident locates the missing money box and they find the seal unbroken. Roy then announces the box will be opened at the showboat that evening.

Reviews:
"What we have here is not so much a western but a darned good mystery thriller instead. There's a bit of action, including a slap- up ruckus in a local cafe, a chase after a runaway buckboard and an ambush in the hills. But the producers have also seen to it that musical tastes are likewise well catered for. Plus a welcome bit of comedy. In all, a solidly entertaining mixture of thrills and spills, songs and sleuths.

Rogers is adequate enough, his performance considerably bolstered by William Haade who makes an admirable sidekick, and Dale Evans as the distraught heroine. In fact by "B" western standards, the support cast is unusually strong. Withers, Heyburn, Shannon and Taliaferro are especially convincing, whilst Bob Nolan is in great voice — as are the rest of his boys.

Marta's moody cinematography is also a tremendous asset. Most of the picture is set at night, giving the plot just the right spooky atmosphere.

Director Joseph Kane, anxious to impress the Republic brass that he was capable of handling more prestigious product (this turned out to be his second last with Rogers), has handled proceedings with remarkable finesse — and even on a couple of occasions, style."
