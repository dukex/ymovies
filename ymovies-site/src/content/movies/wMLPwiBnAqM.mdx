Story:
A cowboy comes to a town at Christmas time. He eats at a cafe but was unable to pay for his meal, so the owner throws him in jail. The town wants to alleviate their guilt over a Mexican family, who has pregnant woman with them, who lives on top of a mountain called Christmas mountain. They bail out the cowboy and tells to bring some old clothes and food to them. While there the young boy of the family feels sorry for him and prays that god will send him some help. It comes in the form of an old friend of his who died years ago. He tells him that he is not exactly living a proper life but he has a chance to turn things around, first by telling the townsfolk that their so called charity towards the Mexicans is not enough.

Review:
Gentle and heart-warming, a low-key, Christmas Western
Cowboys, Christmas, ghosts, human kindness, all in the early 80s: my subconscious could have concocted this just for me. It's Scrooge-esque (Slim Pickens appears a like some gentle Jacob Marley) but our lead guy aint so bad. Good-hearted cowboy sent on a mission to deliver goods by grizzly townsfolk (more like the real Scrooges) to a poor family expecting a baby. They're sheep people but he's a cowboy so never the twain should meet? Thus unfolds a message of harmony between those who are different. 'Little House On The Prairie' feeling of morals and tender emotions (somehow I got wet eyed at his church speech). Carols and folksy Christmas music abounds. Snowy scenes, mellow vibe. Can't think of a more Christmassy western than this.
