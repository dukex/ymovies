<br />
Reviews:<br />
"Ferdinando Baldi is one of those Italian directors who had the magical ability to make great films like this one.<br />
<br />
Franco Nero, one of the best Italian actors of all time once again reaches the pinnacle of acting in this great Italy/Spain co-production.<br />
<br />
If you don't like this movie, you probably won't like any of the 500 westerns that have been shot in Europe, and that means this is not your genre, so forget about it and watch things like "Star trek" or "2001", you'll probably find them more exciting.<br />
<br />
Action, action and more action is what you'll get from this excellent spaghetti-western.<br />
<br />
(10 out of 10)" Written by f.gimenez at IMDb.com <br />
<br />
"Lawman Franco Nero and his younger brother say goodbye to Texas and travel south of the border to seek justice for their long murdered father. They soon discover that the killer is now a wealthy, oppressive landowner with some secrets to tell regarding the two brothers.<br />
<br />
It's not as extravagant as other Italian westerns, but more like an American western in its directness, albeit with some European quirks and a bit more excessive violence.<br />
<br />
Still, it is colorful and entertaining, with good location photography and an excellent musical score. Franco Nero is always good.<br />
<br />
Speaking of Nero, any western with him as the lead invites unfair comparisons to Django. This one is no exception." Written by FightingWesterner on IMDb.com <br />
