"I agree that this TV Western is worth your time. Ernest Borgnine and Sammy Davis Jr play well together. Watch fast for a young William Katt as Borgnine's son. The character of El Grande is played by the excellent Gary Marshal of Camelot (1967) and The Thousand Plane Rain (1968, released July 1969). In this production he is credited as 'Caleb Brooks'. though I do not know why. His performance is memorable and it is a shame he did not do more work on film. His career has been mostly on the stage where his considerable vocal talents have been wowing audiences for many years. Fans also remember him fondly in three episodes of Marlo Thomas' That Girl series playing British Photographer Noel Prince. He can also be viewed in the Vegas (1979) episode 'Lost Monday' as Dr Middleton as well as a cameo in George Clooney's Intolerable Cruelty. Back to the film...I have always enjoyed the music in this production and the script is above average. I can see how it would have made for an entertaining feature film."

"Big name stars with excellent acting in this movie all add to the enjoyment of the search. Fast moving action and a couple of scenes with the heroes getting the upper hand make the movie go by too quickly. Ernie Borgnine and Sammy Davis, Jr. make a great team. Sammy's character's laid-back personality is an exciting contrast to some of the other characters' impatience and prejudice which make you keep on watching. I watched this movie twice tonight to make sure I didn't miss anything - I give it a 10 as I feel each character gave so much strength to the overall picture. Jim Davis and Julie Adams are very talented, seasoned actors and Bucklind Noah Beery was a surprise to me as I never knew Noah Berry, Jr. had a son. Buck has been in other roles I have found by searching the Internet and if he is half as good an actor as his famous father and grandfather he is worth watching."

"a fine made for tv western centering on tracker(Sammy Davis Jr) aiding Earnest Borgnine in the search for his missing daughter. Lots of action for western fans, some familiar character actors, and even some comedic moments." Written by Tony Rome on IMDb.com.<br />
