Reviews:
I just got Red Sun and enjoyed it. It's kinda hard to explain it in writing, you have to watch it. It's worth the time. Charles Bronson fans will like his performance as Link, a thief who's forced to team up with Toshiro Mifune's character Kuroda-a Samurai who has 7 days to get back a sword stolen while traveling to the US capital in 1870(around that time); the sword was to be a gift to the prez.

Toshiro's performace was great, simply great. Fans will like this. It is very odd to hear him speak english...especially when he never really learned it in the first place! There's many great little bits in the movie like when Link is trying to escape from Kuroda...he just can't get away from him. They way Kuroda begins to really relax in the saloon cracks me up..he's usually stiff and mean looking..well, not that mean looking. I voted a 10 for this.... written by Buslady
