Warning: Spoilers
"This is my tenth spaghetti western review,click on the link(above)to see more spaghetti western reviews.

I had never seen any of the Django/Sartana spin-offs until i watched this little gem, and after i watched it, i wanted to see all the others,but anyway,on with the review.

This movie has brilliant acting and loads of action,Hunt Powers is brilliant as Sartana,he's almost as good as Gianni Garko,Franco Borelli,meanwhile,is not so good as Django,he's alright,but Franco Nero is a lot better,but the movies best performance has got to go to veteran spaghetti western actor,Gordon Mitchell,he plays the one most craziest and most insane and most phsycopathic movie villains ever and one of the best movie villains ever,he must have been on a sugar rush when the movie was made because he is a real phsycopath,he gives the performance his all and creates a excellent character,he plays poker with himself via a mirror,lays on a bed and plays with real winchesters just like a kid playing with two plastic cowboy guns and he becomes brutally angry,screaming his head off and punching people and destroying tables in the process,he's absolutely mad,but his character and acting are brilliant,no one else could have played his part,he should have on an Oscar or some kind of award,even in his death scene he is as crazy as ever as he screams in agony as a large knife protrudes from his stomach,in one way he feel sad that he's dead.

There's enough action to keep action fans happy,a few shootouts and several brawls,both of which are loud,fast paced and exciting.The shootouts are really funny and i was in pain from laughing at theme,the stunts the actors do when they are shot are hilarious,during one shootout one man falls head over heels over a railing,it's comedy gold,during the shootout at the end of the movie there's even a few slow motion deaths thrown in,i guess Demofilo Findani(or Dick Spitfire in this movie)was trying to copy the shootout at the climax of The Wild Bunch.The shootout in a dusty western town is brilliantly done also,during which Django kills several men who have come to kill him,the brawls are excellent and there are a lot of them throughout the movie.After the climatic shootout,Django and crazy Burt(Gordon Mitchell) batter each other up,this results in crazy Burt being stabbed and killed with a Rambo knife.

This is a brilliant movie and i would love to see all the other Django/Sartana spin-offs and Fidanis other westerns,i highly recommend this to spaghetti western and action fans,seek this one out as it's a must see." Written by TankGuy on IMDb.com.
