Storyline:
One night, retired gunfighter Django and his son Jeff Tracy are having supper in their cottage when someone knocks at the door. Django opens and a man informs him that his boss, Thompson, wants to see him. Django invites the man inside and starts putting his gun-belt on. When Django turns his back to the late-night visitor, he gets shot in the back and dies. Django's son, who is only 9 years old, witnesses his father's murder and remembers the name mentioned by the intruder, Thompson. Years later, Jeff Tracy is a grown man who is handy with his six shooter. He is on a quest to find his father's murderer and the man called Thompson who apparently ordered the killing of Django. Jeff Tracy's quest leads him to the town of Topeka where a major feud is going on between two strong men bent on taking over the whole county. One man is Clay Ferguson. The other man is Thompson. Jeff Tracy lands right in the middle of the feud and is in grave danger. Luckily, a former gunslinger and friend of Django, reformed as a priest known as Father Gus Fleming, has arrived in town. He tries to dissuade Jeff Tracy from revenge and murder. Written by nufs68

Reviews:
"I disagree with the other reviewer and to my taste this is a superior spaghetti with an off-character performance from Tinti that places him IMHO in a superior niche to anything that Richard Harrison ever did. While this is not a great spaghetti it is a competent film and many of the scenes deserve repeat viewing for interest. This movie contains all of the elements of a fine spaghetti however it is weak in significant areas relating to storyline, continuity and detail. For example, this was not a starring role for Madison. Madison should have been listed as a "featured" cast member, however this detail does not impact the film overall. Yes his entrance is awkward -- almost an after thought -- but he did contribute to the action and I especially liked his line about "an eye-for-an-eye" being different where guns and bullets are concerned! So finally this is (after all) a 1967 period spaghetti, and IMO one of the better ones. Overall I rate this movie as a solid 7 to my taste where 10 would be something like Vengeance or Keoma."
