Free Western Movie in Full Length: Deadwood '76 (1965): A young drifter is mistaken for Billy the Kid. The consequences prove deadly. 

Director: James Landis
Writers: Arch Hall Sr. (screenplay) (as Arch Hall), James Landis 
Stars: Arch Hall Jr., Jack Lester, La Donna Cottier

User Reviews:

Hall and son provide us this time with an earnest effort towards legitimate film making. Hall Jr. is the youngster mistaken for Billy the Kid-and shows glimpses(as he did in the "Sadist")of real acting ability. Unfortunately, this one comes along about a decade too late to ride the crest of popularity that low-budget westerns once enjoyed. Sadly(?) this was Arch Hall Jr.'s screen Swan Song.
