Storyline:
Mountie Matt O'Brien is assigned to escort Miss Owens to a remote outpost. But when he finds an illegal mining operation there that is smuggling gold across the border, his superior Sgt. Means orders him to leave.

Reviews:
This is an enjoyable programmer from Lippert's Action Pictures with a nice interplay between the lovely Joan Woodbury and Bob Steele. Steele plays a Mountie who is unwillingly assigned to lead Woodbury to a remote region in the Canadian Woodlands. Woodbury's feisty character all but steals this film from action star Steele. She looks great on horseback.

There is nothing serious here, just plenty of action, and nice interplay between the two principles. Troubled silent screen star Madge Bellamy, who had starred in Fox's first ever talkie, Mother Knows Best, makes her final screen appearance as the mistreated wife of one of the bad guys.

The video I saw could have been much better. The two-strip Cinecolor was washed, and the images were not as clear as one would like, but these defects in no way took away from the enjoyable factor. Written by Diosprometheus on IMDb.com
