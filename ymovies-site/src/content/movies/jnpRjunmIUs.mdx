Reviews:
Brett Landers, a cowboy, buys cattle from his friend Gil Clawson for his ranch but gets falsely accused of theft. In self-defense, he kills his accuser and faces a lynch mob. Escaping with his gun, Brett vows to return and find the real thief. On his journey, he encounters Lucy, a girl kidnapped and tortured during a stagecoach attack.

Despite helping Lucy, Brett faces suspicion in the nearest town as the real culprits are still at large. Lucy identifies the thieves, including Gil Clawson. One of them, Avery Ranchester, is the son of influential Clayton Ranchester. The trio tries to silence Lucy, kidnapping Brett to stage an escape. Brett escapes, kills one bandit, and flees with Lucy, while Clayton Ranchester turns the crowd against Brett, sparking a mountain manhunt.

Adios Gringo is a thoroughly gripping western that has a hard edge and a certain depth to the characters. There's action but close attention is paid to the plot and characterisation. The pace never falters nor does the challenges for the hero. The hero, of course, is Guiliano Gemma who is a likeable and sympathetic character. His gentleness to the Lucy after her ordeal is touching. The supporting cast includes Nello Pazzafini as the villainous Jack Dawson, Roberto Camardiel as a doctor and Evelyn Stewart as Lucy, all deliver really well. I liked the sheriff - who was a little reluctant to help as he doesn't want to rock the boat and lose his job but finally does the right thing- and the doctor working together to help Brett and Lucy - it was a fun aspect. The finale is a tense showstopper.
