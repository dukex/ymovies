Storyline:<br />
During the 1892 blizzard, pioneer ranching magnate Phil Evarts dies. His Hatchet Ranch is inherited by brother John and daughter Celia. However, much of the ranch is on free grazing land. Many of the local ranchers and cattlemen try to take advantage of Phil Evarts' death by grazing on this land and using its water for free. Ranchers Harve Garrison, Russ Schultz and Ray Cavanaugh desire the Hatchet Ranch's rich grazing land and take it with impunity. Others, like greedy rancher Bide Marriner, want it all for themselves. Even cattle rustlers, like Red Courteen, get involved by rustling cattle from the Evarts family whose power they resent. Because the old rancher Phil Evarts isn't around to protect the Hatchet Ranch anymore, his trusted foreman, Will Ballard, steps-in to safeguard the interests of Phil Evarts' heirs, especially Celia's whom he adores. Celia's fiance, Sam Danfelser, is the jealous type but Celia assures him that she only loves him and she only considers Will a good friend. When Celia's uncle is shot and killed by hired gunmen, sheriff Joe Kneen's help becomes essential to the Evarts. Sensing a difficult situation, the sheriff decides to send a wire message to Santa Fe, asking for federal Marshals' assistance. A panicked Bide Marriner shoots the sheriff in the back at the telegraph office. To make matters worse, Celia Evarts' fiance, Sam Danfelser, betrays her and sides with Bide Marriner's crew. He promises to kill Will Ballard out of jealousy and revenge. He rides in for the final confrontation with Hatchet Ranch's foreman, Will Ballard.<br />

Reviews:<br />
"I am a long time fan of westerns I got it from my father when I was gosh from two years old on he loved them all the TV shows & the movies This movie totally pleasantly surprised me the plot was a typical western good plot but the roles for the women; -I was not familiar with Ella Raines she's not the most beautiful nor the most "curvaceous" but she plays the part of a woman running a ranch even the woman Lotte who is supposed to be more feminine "curvaceous" was also a strong character you just didn't see this in westerns actually in many films we still don't see it today so all in all characters plot calibre of acting layout it was a very satisfying western movie." Written by Bgappl07 on IMDb.com <br />
<br />
"Several offerings of this film are available on YouTube, and I'm surprised that so far there are only two reviews here on IMDB - and these sum up RTMD very well indeed.<br />
<br />
The cast includes many well-known and not so-well-known actors from 1950s Westerns, all of whom acquit themselves well.<br />
<br />
As has been suggested, there was a lot of plot crammed into 90 minutes, and the number of characters' names was such that I had to concentrate to work out who was who. And there were quite a few localities named.<br />
<br />
The fight between Rod Cameron and Forrest Tucker was one of the most impressive I've seen in films of this period, and Ella Raines as Celia Evarts acquitted herself very well against the roughs who invaded her home.<br />
<br />
The final shoot-out in the dark seemed short, almost to the point of being anticlimactic.<br />
<br />
But overall a good Western." Written by Marlburian on IMDb.com <br />
