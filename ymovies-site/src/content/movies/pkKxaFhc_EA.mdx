Reviews:
"Acceptable though middling tortilla Western dealing with ordinary labour of US cavalry while holding off hostile Indians . A court-martialed soldier saves a fort and the Major who falsely testified against him from an Indian attack . O'Hara (German Cobos) , cavalry officer , saves the fiancée (Marisa Pavan) of Brush (Mariano Vidal Molina) , his superior officer , a man who hates him from an Indian attack . Mary who has fallen in love with O'Hara embraces him . Brush on a peace mission to the Navajos instead attacks them , causing the Navajos and the Apaches to join forces . The Indians led by Red Feather (Rafael Albaicin) attack the fort commanded by Colonel Robert Patterson (Tomás Blanco) and Brush is mortally wounded and then admits his responsibility for the prior defeat , the reason of his enmity toward O'Hara .

Passable Chorizo Western with a professional Spanish filmmaker , B-actors , a lot of Spanish secondaries and expert technicians . All in all, this film is predominantly a Spanish film rather than an Italian one. It's a utterly Spanish Western , though by that time to be ordinary Spanish/Italian co-productions in which were clearly dominated by the Italian contingent and the traditional leanings of the Spanish producers of the time have their stamp on the entire proceedings . The Spanish westerns of this era were far more likely to try and emulate their American source material than cultivate a distinctive style of their own the way the Italians were doing but their product, if you like traditional westerns remains watchable . Customary Western that doesn't follows the Sergio Leone wake , but it is proceeded in American models . It's an exciting western with breathtaking shootouts and facing off between cavalry and Indians ."
