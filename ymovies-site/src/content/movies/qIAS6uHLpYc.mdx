Storyline:
The Sorenson family is massacred, apparently by Indians. On the site of the killing, a town, Gold Hill grows up, run by a group of businessmen. Years later, El Rojo, alias the last surviving Sorenson arrives, bringing the truth about the massacre, and revenge.

Reviews:
"Pretty predictable from the word go … or at least as soon as our leading citizens start getting threats via Indian arrow. The surprise here isn’t so much the plot, but some of the methods Sorenson uses to exact his vengeance.

As for El Rojo, he’s referred to that precisely one time in this version of the film. And we never are really clued in about the back-story between Sorenson and Consuelo.

Two moments you’re likely to remember: The appearance of a fast gun for hire named Black Bart who wears a mask over the lower half of his face to hide a horrific scar, and a rousing rendition of the song “To the West We Shall Go” by Nieves Navarro’s character."
