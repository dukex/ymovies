Storyline:<br />
Walter Brennan is back as the clever and funny over the hill Texas Ranger Nash Crawford. This time the gang must face corruption in their own hometown. The gang put their heads together to clean up their town, take back the rule of law, and rehabilitate the town lush (played by Fred Astaire) along with way.<br />
<br />
Reviews:<br />
"The first Over-The-Hill-Gang movie proved so popular on television that a sequel was practically demanded from producers Walter Brennan, Aaron Spelling and Danny Thomas. Probably only the age of the protagonists kept this from becoming a regular series. Maybe if Walter Brennan, Edgar Buchanan, and Chill Wills had been ten years younger it might very well have become a weekly series.<br />
<br />
After settling things in Nevada for Pat O'Brien in the first movie the other three retired Texas Rangers go back to their settled lives and then they receive another summons. It's from Andy Devine who was a crooked judge in the first movie, but who now is a newspaper editor in Waco. An old friend of their's, the Baltimore Kid has been accused of a stagecoach robbery and murder. When Brennan, Wills, and Buchanan, arrive in Waco they hear the Baltimore Kid has been lynched for those crimes.<br />
<br />
But that can't be when they spot the Baltimore Kid in a saloon looking three sheets to the wind. The Kid is played by Fred Astaire who finally got a western to his credits. He dances nary a step, but he staggers a lot.<br />
<br />
The old Rangers sober him up the way Robert Mitchum was in El Dorado and Lee Marvin in Cat Ballou and clear the blot upon his reputation. So much so that the town offers to make him marshal. After that they have to stay around and back him up so he doesn't get himself killed. And that gang that did the robbery is still around.<br />
<br />
Brennan, Wills, Devine, and Buchanan settle back comfortably in their parts. So does Lillian Bronson who Buchanan was about to get married to when the second summons comes. Parley Baer plays the unctuous mayor of the town and Lana Wood plays a femme fatale saloon girl with quite a scheme of her own.<br />
<br />
If you liked the first Over-The-Hill Gang movie, no reason you won't like The Over-The-Hill Gang Rides Again." Written by bkoganbing on IMDb.com.<br />
<br />
"Low budget TV film reunites some veterans of Hollywood in a no surprise western parody. Houseman, Astaire, Buchanan and the great Walter Brennan seems to have fun doing that. So we have watching it, just for entertainment. They makes smiles at western cliches. It's the only western Astaire ever made. It's also your only chance - I think - to see him with a mustache!"
