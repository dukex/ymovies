Storyline:
A stranger named Johnny MaGee (Giancomo Rossi-Stuart) arrives in a mining community and instantly runs into trouble with a couple of henchmen working for Anthony Burton (Aldo Sambrell). Seems Burton is gaining control of all the richest mines in the area, by legal means, it seems, though the sheriff has a jail cell reserved for Burton should his suspicions prove correct. At the moment, Burton’s trying to get his hands on the mine of old-timer Thomas Nathaniel Livingstone, but he’s reluctant to sell. In fact, he take son Johnny as a partner, hoping the two of them will finally find gold there. Ah, but acquiring mines isn’t the only way Burton is exerting control over the townsfolk. He’s also the only one buying gold within a two-week ride, meaning he can set the price as low as he wants. And should he want something other than a mine, he’ll find a way to accomplish that too. For instance, he’s got the local doctor deep in debt because of a gambling habit. He offers to wipe out all those debts in exchange for the doctor’s sister (Krista Nell as Molly) in marriage. That’s not going to sit well with Molly, who’s falling for Johnny, or with Julie (Diana Lorys), Burton’s saloon singer of a mistress. Meanwhile, Johnny can count on a helping hand from a bounty hunter named Ted (Mario Novelli), who shows up and decides this town might turn out to be pretty profitable.

Reviews:
"I think this is more usually known in English as DJANGO, KILL, or DJANGO KILL (no comma). Known for completely over the top wild violence and rivers of red blood. Some see a very hidden homo-erotic perversity to it, but there is so much general perversity all around in it, who can say if one more flavor matters? It is kind of fun (if that is the word) to see it if you put it in the context of all the other Italian Spaghetti Westerns of the 1960s. Watch the documentary "Spaghetti West" to see how this one fits into the overall trend. Coming to it cold with no background, it may just seem crazy. As, indeed, I think it is somewhat."
