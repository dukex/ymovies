Story:<br />
Johnny looks so much like the real Jesse, he is mistaken for him by a grizzled old member of the now deceased James gang. Johnny is talked into leading a new gang to rob banks using the same modus operandi as the famed outlaw. Jesse's brother Frank decides to put a stop to the defamation of his dead brother's name. Johnny and his gang run into trouble when they try to rob the same two banks, simultaneously, that proved to be the downfall of the original gang.<br />
<br />
Review:<br />
A very good 'film noir' western<br />
Ireland is the Jesse James look-alike that tries to out-do the famed gangster. Hadley is Frank James, determined to preserve his dead brothers reputation. This is a tight little western that moves at a nice pace, featuring fine action from a notable supporting cast. Although not as dark and moody as "I Shot Jesse James"(1949), with Ireland back in the lead, this makes a nice companion piece from Lippert Pictures. Written by bux on imdb.com<br />
