<br />
Storyline:<br />
Ringo Carson has a tough life. First, he has a falling out with his best friend, Frank Sanders, after saving Jane, the girl he loves, from Mexican kidnappers in order to extort a ransom from her gunrunner father. Frank goes off to the Civil War. Ringo reconciles with his estranged mother who needs his fast gun to protect her land from greedy land-grabber Daniels. Then Frank returns from...<br />
<br />
Reviews:<br />
"Ringo and his buddy Frank are two guns for hire, sent by a local businessman to retrieve his daughter from some pesky Mexican bandits. After shooting several hundred bandits and getting the daughter back, it turns out that Frank is in love with this chick, but she has the hots for Ringo, and they intend to marry. Following a punch up, Frank heads out of town and Ringo marries, settling down with his missus and becoming sheriff, also reconciling with his mum, who owns land that an evil banker wants at all costs.<br />
<br />
Got all that? It gets more complicated as war breaks out, Ringo gets blinded by accident and Frank takes over as sheriff in town, joining forces with the evil banker in order to get the land from Ringo's mum. When Ringo's mum gets killed and Ringo badly beaten, the blind guy goes on the warpath to bring everyone down, using his guns, his crazy friend, and a whole load of cannons and gunfire.<br />
<br />
3 Bullets for Ringo is solid Spaghetti Western madness. Every time Ringo goes into battle scores of bad guys get wasted, and there's a full on gun battle involving cannons in a cave system, and a climatic battle in town between the good guys and the bad guys, with the survivors literally stepping over all the corpses to get to each other.<br />
<br />
Gordon Mitchell sure was ugly though, eh? Plus, fans of realism might want to stay away from this one though, as Ringo can gun down entire armies of bad guys without reloading or even using cover. As to be expected from an Italian film, everything looks great, especially the scene where three bad guys beat the crap out of Ringo and his family. There's also some sort of weird voodoo ceremony and the bad guys planning to roast Ringo's son over a fire. Fans of Spaghetti Westerns should track this one down. The opening credits are rather groovy too!" Written by Bezenby on IMDb.com.<br />
<br />
"Former hired gun Mickey Hargitay rescues his future wife from bandits, reconciles with his mother, becomes sheriff, and is blinded in the Civil War. He then finds himself clashing with a nasty banker and his old partner Gordon Mitchell, the town's new sheriff.<br />
<br />
Despite it's ultra-low budget, odd bits of humor, and very loose plot, I can't help but be entertained by this spaghetti western, in a so-bad-it's-good kind of way.<br />
<br />
It's a lot of fun to see overwrought muscle-men Hargitay and Mitchell chewing the scenery together in the same movie, though not nearly as much as Mickey did the previous year in the crackpot horror classic, The Bloody Pit Of Horror.<br />
<br />
The filmmakers appear to have thrown in everything but the kitchen sink, including a Voodoo ceremony (!), actors named John Heston, and Spean Convery, and a fleeting character that appears to have been dubbed by an actor impersonating Jimmy Stewart!" Written by FightingWesterner on IMDb.com.<br />
