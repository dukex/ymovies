Storyline:
Two men pull off a bank heist, making sure to leave no witnesses behind.

But when they meet up with a third partner to split the loot, they wind up staked out and bitten to death by poisonous snakes.

Flash forward two years and Lloyd’s of London agent Jonathan Pinkerton (Robert Woods) shows up in Red Stone, determined to find that third partner, convinced a bank employee was involved.

And he makes it known around town that a $200,000 reward awaits the individual who helps him crack the case. That, naturally, attracts lots of interest.

Pinkerton also winds up with a growing list of suspects, including a sheriff (Frank Brana) who never seems to be around when he’s needed, a rancher on the brink of financial ruin (Ivano Staccioli), a hotel owner with a questionable past (Carlo Gaddi) and a doctor (Ernesto Colli) with a strange fascination for snakes.

Then, just when Pinkerton — known as Mr. London around town — starts to unravel the mystery, dead bodies start showing up.

And he winds up in jail, accused of being responsible for some of those deaths.

Reviews:
"The opening will draw you in. A cowboy walks into a saloon, exchanges glances with a cavalry officer, then walks back out and head to the bank. He robs it, shooting everyone inside. So no one can interfere, the man dressed like a cavalry officer kills everyone in the bar. And when the bank manager emerges wounded, but preparing to fire a shot at the fleeing bandit, he’s gunned down from a second-story window.

Soon, the cowboy and the cavalry officer are dead, and that mysterious man from the second-story window is riding off with the loot. And nine minutes into the film, not a word has been spoken.

After that, it plays out like a mystery as much as a Western, with Woods getting himself out of just as many jams with his quick thinking and his fists as with his guns.

Oh, and Nieves Navarro is up to her old gold-digging tricks again. The Italian beauty is married to the saloon owner, but having an affair with the rancher and seemingly quite intrigued by the reward Pinkerton is offering." Written by Mark Franklin on http://onceuponatimeinawestern.com

"Now, here is a genuine Western Giallo! During a bank robbery, three robbers get away with quite a lot of cash but slaughter a vast amount of people to get it. We see the faces of two of these guys, but third is kept a secret, and shortly after the other two are killed by extremely fake looking snakes, we find out why - the murderer has assumed a different identity and is hiding out in a frontier town, and it's up to George Hilton lookalike Robert Woods to find them.

Robert is playing a man called Jonathan Pinkerton, send for Lloyds Bank London to find the missing money. He is immediately given the name Mr London as he goes around the town trying to figure out what's going on...a town which seems to be suffering from a plague of snakes. Suspects include a snake studying doctor who claims the snakes tell him things, sheriff Frank Bana who is equally suspicious of Pinkerton, shifty ranch owner Clinton, the guys who owns the bar and his sneaky girlfriend Susan Scott."
