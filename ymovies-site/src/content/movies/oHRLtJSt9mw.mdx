Frog's magic gets Gene's release and Gene finds Tex. But Tex is a prisoner and Gene quickly finds himself a prisoner also.<br />
<br />
Reviews:<br />
"It's well directed. Gene's and Smiley Burnette's banter is well done; the film's tightly edited and really zips along, even though I've only seen the 54 minute cut version. It speeds by like the feature version of 'The Phantom Empire' (1935), including many different scene changes and fast action.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, it's well written -- it's a crazy quilt of juxtaposed elements that raise it way above the level of tedious, dreary, formulaic, slow going 1930s Westerns. A bizarre story. Good comic relief this time from Smiley Burnette and a gorilla. Typical 30s musical racial stereotypes. A covered wagon going through the jungle. The obligatory exciting horseback final chase sequence. Great music.<br />
<br />
The great songs include 'Dinah (Is There Anyone Finer),' and 'Revival Day,' sung by the Cabin Kids; 'Round Up Time in Texas,' sung at the beginning by Gene, Frog, and all the wranglers, and at the end by Gene, Frog, and the Cabin Kids, with Chief Busoto on harmonica; and a short reprise of 'Uncle Noah's Ark' by Gene and Frog, which they perform full length in 'The Phantom Empire.'<br />
<br />
Is this a Jungle movie? A Western? Who cares!! It's one of the real treats of junk cinema! I give it a 7." Written by Chance2000esl on IMDb.com <br />
