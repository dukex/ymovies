Storyline:<br />
In 1900, unscrupulous timber baron Jim Fallon plans to take advantage of a new law and make millions off California redwood. Much of the land he hopes to grab has been homesteaded by a Quaker colony, who try to persuade him to spare the giant sequoias...but these are the very trees he wants most. Expert at manipulating others, Fallon finds that other sharks are at his own heels, and forms an unlikely alliance.<br />
<br />
Reviews:<br />
Warning: Spoilers<br />
"This is a story about a young opportunist and slick-talker (Kirk Douglas as Fallon) who leaves his floundering lumber operation in Wisconsin in order to exploit a piece of Federal Lands Claims legislation that went into effect in 1900. Hoping to make a quick fortune, he heads for northern California and the vast tracks of Redwoods and Sequoias there.<br />
<br />
The plot's central conflict is developed when Fallon/Douglas encounters a community of nature-loving religious pacifists who have been living for years on the land that he hopes to harvest. Much attention is paid, in this film, to the simple arguments presented by these people who consider the giant trees to be sacred reminders of God's greatness. The forest is their church, and they strive to convince would-be (de)foresters such as Fallon that the trees are more valuable left standing than being cut down and used for lumber.<br />
<br />
Douglas' performance is nuanced and convincing, as he portrays the deep internal transformations that his character goes through. In addition, there is a truly remarkable action sequence--clearly the great grand-daddy of all of Tom Cruise's (et al.) exploits--in which Douglas leaps aboard a runaway train.<br />
<br />
In a silent "wink" to savvy audience members, the mock-Spanish name of the California county where all this takes place is written on a sign over the door of the courthouse: San Hedrin." Written by lyonefein on IMDb.com.<br />
<br />
"The story was set on a historical event which took place during the McKinley administration in 1900. Apparently, land with the giant redwoods was opened up for grabs by allowing lumber companies to pay for new claims, even for land which had been settled by homesteaders under an 1868 act of Congress. Our hero Jim Fallon heads west with cronies from Wisconsin to make his fortune. As the story unfolds with some tragedy, he is forsaken by former associates, and warms to his new friends, the Quakers who had settled the land before. Indeed, he turns the tide in their favor, thus redeeming himself, and winning the girl.<br />
<br />
The movie was excellent with great stunts, seemingly performed by Douglas himself. It is really instructive to see how much good film action was done long before digital effects. Indeed, this movie could give you a real taste for quality movies of mid-20th century." Written by jjmmcd on IMDb.com.<br />
