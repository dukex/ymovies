Reviews:
Warning: Spoilers
"A BOUNTY KILLER FOR TRINITY is a grim, dark, violent little movie which turned out better than it probably had to be. This is another one of those ultra low budget Italian Westerns filmed on the ramshackle sets & familiar gravel pit owned and made by genre star Gordon Mitchell with his own resources and bare hands that served as the backdrop for about three dozen similar efforts made between 1970 and 1973 or so, a story that is actually more inspiring than the interchangeable threadbare plots of the films themselves.

Directors like Joe D'amato, Miles Deem, Frank Kramer and Anthony Ascott used the sets and outdoor locations like a Holodeck, creating worlds & places out of nothing. Costs were kept at a minimum with friends or co-workers pitching in with production crew work or bit parts, with a "stock" cast of actors brought in to fill the speaking roles. This week someone would play the gunslinger, next week they would be the Padre or maybe a crooked sheriff.

A BOUNTY KILLER FOR TRINITY is actually one of the better efforts, with "Jeff Cameron" cast as a laconic, remorseless and highly efficient bounty killer hired by the scheming bigwigs of a tumbleweed nowhere to rid their budding community of some local Banditos who have the run of the place and are making their lives miserable -- see also Corbucci's NAVAJO JOE and TOM HORN with Steve McQueen for other examples of this premise. As with most Euro Westerns the lead anti-hero is armed with a clever killing contraption (ala Sabata's shotgun pistol) and this time it is a crossbow, with throwing knives, Derringer pistols, a sawed off shotgun, as well good old six shooters & Winchester repeaters also coming into play depending upon what would make a better shot. Here is an equal opportunity minded hired assassin.

Jeff Cameron is very good in the lead, bringing a sense of quiet disappointment and weariness about having to kill another bunch of sadistic brutes, with an ending that is actually rather evocative of DIRTY HARRY -- He takes no pride in his actions (unlike a wisecracking Sartana or ultra-cool Clint Eastwood), carries a sheaf of wanted posters for reference to make sure he is killing the right people and what the going rate is for their heads, and mastered the ability to roll a cigarette using tobacco tucked into a vest pocket for his performance. The film still has the comic book mentality of a good Anthony Ascott Spaghetti, but the affair is tinged with an air of regret for the loss of life, which is a refreshing change of pace for a genre that usually has a gleeful, sadistic attitude about violence and death."
