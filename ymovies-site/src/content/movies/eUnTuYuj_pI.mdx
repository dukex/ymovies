PLOT (Wikipedia): A trio of cowboys, Vern (Cameron Mitchell), Wes (Jack Nicholson) and Otis (Tom Filer), stop to rest for the night at the remote hideout of a gang of outlaws led by Blind Dick (Harry Dean Stanton). In the morning, they find themselves surrounded by a vigilante hanging party and are forced to become fugitives due to a case of mistaken identity.

Otis is killed. So are accomplices of Blind Dick, who is lynched. Vern and Wes take refuge at a farm belonging to Evan (George Mitchell), who lives alone with his wife and daughter, holding them hostage until they can make an escape. After a member of the vigilantes passes by, the two try to take Evan's horses and he shoots at them, wounding Vern before he is killed himself.

Wes and Vern ride off together on one horse with the posse in pursuit. Eventually Vern can go no farther but holds off the posse until Wes can safely get away.
