Free Western Movie: Pecos Cleans Up - Spaghetti Western - Three musicians arrive in a Mexican village destroyed by El Supremo and learn, from the only survivor, of the lost treasure of Montezuma hidden in an Aztec temple. Along comes Pecos and the search is on.<br />
<br />
Pecos Cleans Up (1967)<br />
Director: Maurizio Lucidi<br />
Writers: Adriano Bolzoni (screenplay), Augusto Caminito (screenplay) <br />
Stars: Robert Woods, Erno Crisa, Luciana Gilli <br />
Genres: Western <br />
Country: Italy<br />
Language: English<br />
Release Date: 8 December 1967 (West Germany)<br />
Also Known As: Döden rider bredvid <br />
<br />
Storyline:<br />
Three mariachi performers stumble upon a ranch being raided by El Supremo’s henchmen. They watch as every man and woman is killed.<br />
<br />
The raiders are looking for a map to the lost treasure of Montezuma. They don’t find it, but after they’ve left the scene of the crime, the mariachi performers do — hidden in a pigeons’ pen.<br />
<br />
Ah, but there’s a problem. The temple that El Supremo has turned into a hideout is precisely where the treasure is hidden. And they have no chance of penetrating a temple guarded by El Supremo’s small army of henchmen.<br />
<br />
Then they meet a seemingly indestructable fast gun named Pecos Martinez (Robert Woods). He’s willing to take on the challenge. After all, there are 30 pounds of hidden gold buried in the caverns beneath the temple.<br />
<br />
Reviews:<br />
"Apart from the dreadful south American dubbing of my DVD I must admit that PECOS CLEANS UP (AKA Pecos and the treasure of Moctezuma) is a good way to spend 90 minutes, if you are into Spaghetti westerns this one is a exotic rarity that you don't want to miss.<br />
<br />
Imagine the only descendant of Moctezuma who rules a gang of ruthless bandits and lives inside an Aztec pyramid craved on a lost canyon, that's the villain...now imagine that the lost gold of Moctezuma is somewhere in a cave and our hero (and three mariachis) are the only ones who knows where to find the treasure, there's also a map and a bunch of soldiers...strange story for a western? sure, but it works fine and is also a movie for the entire family, not much violence, total absence of sex, some funny jokes and bloodless shootouts make the movie suitable for kids and probably they will enjoy it a lot." Written by bizz-2 on IMDb.com.<br />
<br />
"A sequel to 1966’s “My Name is Pecos,” this film has a lighter tone. In fact, it’s only connection to the earlier film is the presence of Robert Woods as Pecos Martinez.<br />
<br />
It’s not as good either, as Pecos almost effortlessly eliminates El Supremo’s band of ruffians, frees two women — Dona Ramona and Eliza — who are being held captive and discovers the lost gold with amazing ease.<br />
<br />
If you’re looking for clever, Pecos does use the weak spots of El Supremo’s lieutenants to eliminate them and his men. So Dago dies partly as a result of his gluttony, “Frenchie” because of his lust and El Rayo (Lighting) because of his greed.<br />
<br />
Of course, it all leads up to a showdown between the rope/whip wielding El Supremo, who dreams of controlling all of Mexico, and Pecos, who only wants to get rich. He’s even willing to share with his mariachi friends." Written by Mark Franklin on onceuponatimeinawestern.com.<br />
