Reviews:
"FURY OF THE APACHES is an early spaghetti western made before the stratospheric success of Sergio Leone's A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, and thus it has little in common with the Eastwood film. Instead it feels very much like an updating of the John Ford classic STAGECOACH mixed with Howard Hawks' RIO BRAVO, featuring a bunch of characters fending off a frenzied mob of Apache Indians who are more than a little upset about the sudden death of their leader at the hands of one of the group.

On paper, FURY OF THE APACHES sounds decent enough although it's the type of film let down by the lack of budget and expertise that makes it a lacklustre experience throughout. It's a noisy production, sure, with a lot of action scenes, but fewer of them are entertaining than you'd expect and the end result is all too familiar and much the same as any number of Ameircan B-movie westerns. The only time this film really rises above the norm is during a speeding stagecoach chase which is well staged given the constraints." Written by Leofwine_draca on IMDb.com 

"Way back in 1939 a short story, Stage Station, was written by legendary western writer, Ernest Haycox, of Union Pacific & Stagecoach fame. This story was used at least twice by Hollywood, Apache Trail (1942) & Apache War Smoke (1952).

Now I know very little about Eduardo Guzmán, (aka Edward Goodman) who is credited with writing the novel that this movie is supposedly based on, but I can sure as hell spot the same story when it is used frequently.

Apache Trail & Apache War Smoke both credit the writing honours to Ernest Haycox, Apache Fury makes no mention of him, which I find very strange as the story used is practically a carbon copy.

A wagon train station is used as a sanctuary by a wagon that has come under Indian attack. The station master is known by some of the passengers and hanger-ons. The wagon is also carrying a large sum of money, which becomes the sole focus of a couple of no-goods. All the while the Indians have a very real reason for wanting one of the passengers, he mistakenly killed a chief of some friendly Indians.

There are some minor differences from the Haycox story, but not many nor are they important parts of the plot.

The genesis of this movie is very disappointing in my opinion." Written by Asgardian on IMDb.com
