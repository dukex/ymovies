Storyline:<br />
A fictionalized account of the real-life adventure of the Sager family. Travelling with a wagon train from Missouri to Oregon, things are going well for them, until Henry Sager dies from blood poisoning following an Indian attack, and Naomi Sager dies soon afterward from pneumonia. The leaders of the wagon train decide to send the children back, but the oldest, John (who had been described by all the adults as lazy and worthless), decides to lead his siblings through the wilderness to complete the journey their parents started. Written by Jean Marc Rocher.<br />
<br />
Reviews:<br />
"I have no idea why it is rated so poorly. My whole family was glued to the TV. It was very emotionally moving. Yes, some of the acting may be a bit sub-par, but what an inspiring, invigorating tale. If you've got children, they will love it.<br />
<br />
And it's not Just For Children. I'm in my 40's and love films including Pulp Fiction and Fargo, but I was totally engrossed by this tale of seven children who refused to give up on their father's dreams. Near the end, I was close to tears as the story got more and more dramatic.<br />
<br />
What makes this story so compelling is that it's based on fact. It's great to have a beautiful story that doesn't rely on huge budgets, phony story lines, expensive technology, and computer graphics. This is old fashioned movie making: based on a good story! Be sure to see if you enjoy wholesome, family oriented, adventure." Written by contact-258 on IMDb.com<br />
<br />
"I never read the book that this movie's based on. It's about the Sager Party. The father, Henry, the mother Naome, and six children, starting with the oldest son, John, who leave Missouri for Oregon along the Oregon Trail in 1844. At the time they leave, Naome, John's mother, is pregnant with a seventh child. Catherine, born along the way, comes into a world of hardship. Henry dies of blood poisoning in an Indian raid. Naome, the mother, dies of pneumonia. The other members of the wagon train don't want John and his six brothers and sisters in the wagon train and order them to go back to Missouri. All the men in the wagon train regard John as shiftless and lazy. However, John refuses to turn back and is determined to get his family to Oregon. Along the way, they meet Kit Carson, and other historical characters. A couple of reviewers didn't like it. I liked it when it was on TV back in '70s. It should be remembered that back in the '70s, it didn't take very long for movies to make it to television from the movie screen." Written by bcolquho on IMDb.com<br />
