Mickey Hargitary plays Ringo Carson, one of three friends who rescue pretty Jane Walcom (Milla Sannoner) from Mexican bandits in return for a ransom from her father. Those friends include Tom (Spartaco Conversi) and Frank Sanders (Gordon Mitchell).

But Ringo and Frank have a falling out over Jane. Years later, Ringo and Jane are married and have a young son. Ringo, now a sheriff, is called on to help a neighboring town where Confederate marauders are on a rampage. He’s blinded rescuing a young boy; then saved by one of the marauders, none other than Frank Sanders.

But without his sight, Ringo can do little to help his mother, and she’s in a desperate situation.

A banker named Daniels is after her land for the gold mine on it. He’s forged an allegiance with Jane’s father, who has found it more difficult to sell guns to the Mexicans with Ringo as sheriff.

And now they enlist the help of Frank and his men, even making Frank the new sheriff.
