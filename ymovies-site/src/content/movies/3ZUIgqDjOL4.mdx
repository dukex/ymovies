The "Trinity" crew makes another modern era film. Plata and Salud are pilots ditching aircraft for insurance money. They wind up crashing for real in the jungles of South America.

Reviews:<br />
"I love these guys! Most their movies I saw as a child but even seeing them now I still consider them my all-time favorites & I can still watch them over & over & over without getting the least bit tired of them. "All The Way Boys" takes them away from the ole west but still carries the same great clean & fun humor these guys are known for. You will see LOTS of actors from previous/future Hill/Spencer films in this one. Lots of fun to watch & even the actors looked like they had a lot of fun filming it. I hope one day someone will have their full catalog of films released on DVD. Perhaps a box set?? Great movie with a very catchy soundtrack. If you can find a copy, sit back & enjoy."<br />
