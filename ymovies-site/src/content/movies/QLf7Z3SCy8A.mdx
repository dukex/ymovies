Gunfighters is a 1947 American Western movie, directed by George Waggner and starring Randolph Scott, Barbara Britton, and Bruce Cabot. Based on the novel Twin Sombreros by Zane Grey (the sequel of Knights of the Range) and with a screenplay by The Searchers author Alan Le May, the film is about a gunfighter who lays down his guns after being forced to shoot his best friend, and decides to become a cowhand on a ranch.
