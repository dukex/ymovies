Reviews:<br />
This three-episode television classic was filmed in 1949 and introduced Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels as the Lone Ranger and Tonto. This seminal film details the Masked Man's origins as a Texas Ranger who was ambushed with five fellow rangers by outlaw Butch Cavendish, the Ranger's recovery with Tonto's help, why he conceals his identity with a mask, how he finds Silver, and their round-up and arrest of the Cavendish gang. Moore and Silverheels were perfect as the two leads in this series and portrayed the characters as no one else could have. They were supported by some of the old-school, venerable character actors of the day such as Glenn Strange, George Lewis, Tris Coffin, George Chesboro, and Walter Sande. The crisp black and white photography stands up well with time and the Lone Ranger "mood music" is a superb, nostalgic accompaniment to the program. Each of the three episodes is wonderfully narrated by way of introduction, and the narration is also used introduce key plot situations.<br />
