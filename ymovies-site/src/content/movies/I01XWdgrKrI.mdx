Storyline:
Forsythe, who uses his wife as bait, has gained a reputation as a gunslinger. When the game backfires, and she is killed, he sets out in pursuit, but a mysterious rider joins the chase. 

Reviews:
"George Forsyte (Carlos Quiney) is a notorious bounty killer who is doing his best to earn a grand total of half a million dollars before retiring.  He specialises in setting traps for his victims, drawing them in by using his wife Gladys (María Mahor) as bait, pretending that she’s an innocent on the road carrying plenty of easily purloinable cash; and when he catches them, he shows no mercy, killing them with his trademark technique of a bullet in the forehead.  Things go badly wrong, however, when he tries to bring in vicious killer Joe Saxon (Vidal Molina).  Distracted momentarily by a poisonous snake, he allows Saxon to escape and Gladys is murdered as a result.  Naturally enough, he wants to have revenge, but this doesn’t work out either: before he can get to him Saxon is killed – and the reward on his head is collected – by another bounty hunter called Robert MacGregor (Peter Lee Lawrence).

While Forsyte spends time licking his wounds, MacGregor sets off to capture another villain, Ross Steward (Stan Cooper).  Steward and his men are hiding out in the hills, where they’re forcing the local Indians to mine salt, but MacGregor’s initial efforts to locate him result in him being badly beaten and left for dead.  Nursed back to health by tasty squaw Yuma (Malisa Longo), he finds his work has become further complicated by the reappearance of Forsyte, whose motivations have become even less clear following his wife’s death.

In fact, for the first forty minutes or so it all works very well, but then it shifts focus with the death of Joe Saxon at about the forty minute mark.  At this point Forsyte fades rather into the background – until the final stages of the film at least – and the less defined Macgregor, who had hardly featured previously, takes centre stage.  Several new characters are also introduced, including the erratic Steward and the Indians (who look like nothing so much as escapees from a hippie festival), which acts to defuse the mood and ambience which had developed so nicely. In effect it plays like two parts of a TV series joined together into a feature length production, which raises the question as to whether this was intentional or whether one of the stars was perhaps unavailable for some of the filming and the script had to be adapted at the last moment.
