Reviews:<br />
"I can finally mark TWO CROSSES AT DANGER PASS (1967) off my most wanted list, being a long-time fan of the actor Peter Martell, I was ecstatic when I saw this film was being released by Wild East Productions. While it's a technically solid film and a great looking transfer from Wild East, the film unfortunately is a run of the mill spaghetti western. After a heartbreaking opening scene where a young boy named Alex Mitchell sees his mother and father shot down and a man named Powell (Miguel del Castillio) being lynched whom Alex's father the sheriff (Jesus Puente) was trying to protect. A man named Moran (Armando Calvo) runs the town of Danger Pass and wants the water rights on Powell's farm and has framed him for the murder of a young girl. The sheriff tries to hide Powell at his ranch but Moran knows he's there and after a shoot out where Moran' s son is killed, Moran has the house set afire until the sheriff, his wife, daughter and Powell evacuate the burning structure. Moran shoots the sheriff, his wife and strings up Powell and takes the sheriff's young daughter and forces her into servitude. Alex the young boy is found by a travelling family of Quakers who try to instill a non-violent philosophy in Alex, but he is set on revenge and practices shooting constantly until the day arrives when he's a man and rides out to extract his revenge and find his sisterJudy. Mark (Luis Gaspar) who is the son of the Quaker family, follows Alex after he leaves and tries to divert his mind from revenge. Alex (Peter Martell, as an adult) is reunited with his sister Judy (Mara Cruz) at the graves of their parents, Judy who is just ate up with hate, tells Alex as they solemnly look down at the graves, " I know today their happy because you've come back to avenge their deaths." Judy makes Alex promise her their at the grave site to avenge them, Alex says he's full of hate for the Moran's but realizes that Judy hates them more than he does. She continues one "only find rest when murderer Moran is lying dead at my feet."<br />

The Wild East release is another beautiful presentation to go along with the other release on this disc GARRINGO. The print used is very nice with nicely muted colors and some eye catching scenes and some wonderful framed shots including the killing of the Mitchell's, Alex as a boy crying as he watches his parents being shot down and the late in the day blue skies and unfocused background is another finely realized scene. The night scenes are well lit and the lighting used on the film was spot on perfect and this translated nicely to the print on hand. The soundtrack has a few pops and hisses, but very few, the theme song Without Name is sung by Raul Lovecchio, here only credited as Raoul, he's most famously known in Spaghetti Western circles for singing the feverish theme song Gold in the film KILL THEM ALL AND COME BACK ALONE (also available through Wild East Productions).<br />
