Reviews:
"Ossorio's well-crafted and exciting spaghetti-paella western is set in the colorful Canadian wilderness amidst a violent beef between Native trappers and Canadian mountain cops. Eurocult cinema veteran George Martin stars as a tough trapper on a revenge mission after the authorities murder his brother. Beautiful landscapes, great cast, lots of shootouts, fun fight scenes (including a knife fight between two gorgeous women in a cabin), thrilling horseback pursuits, and an impressively staged final battle between trappers and police with tons of extras and cool stunts. No sleaze or brutal violence, though the body count is quite high, but still highly entertaining and worthy of repeat watches. Earlier this year, MVD released this on blu in the US with an excellent looking transfer. This definitely makes me want to check out Ossorio's other western, Tomb of the Pistolero (1964)."
