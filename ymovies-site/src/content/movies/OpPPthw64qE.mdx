Story:
Two black bounty hunters ride into a small town out West in pursuit of an outlaw. They discover that the town has no sheriff, and soon take over that position, much against the will of the mostly white townsfolk. They raise hell, chase women, and milk the locals for cash, while waiting for the opportunity to get their man.

Review:
Surprising decent Blaxploitation/Grandfather to Django Unchained
This was way better than I expected it to be. Fred Williamson is wonderful and badass, and his sidekick is great too. The characters are believable and the situation is interesting and entertaining.

The film does have the typical Blaxploitation problem of having a bad ending. one dimensional villains and supporting characters who don't go anywhere (the blacksmith character).

But the film itself is well made and entertaining. give it a watch if you like the genre. Written by irishboy141 on imdb.com
