Storyline:
Food is getting scarce for the tribe, and the chief must choose between the advice of Baluk to go north to the caribou herds, or the conniving medicine man Dagwan to stay put. On the way north they endure great hardship, and the conflict between Baluk and Dagwan deepens. It doesn't help that both want to marry the chief's daughter.

Reviews:
"One of a number of fiction films of the 1920's and 1930's that attempt to show the life of primitive peoples before contact with European material culture. The best known example is Nanook of the North (1922).

Very well done, with much location shooting under trying circumstances for both the Ojibwe Indian cast and the crew. Interesting wild animal sequences, especially of the caribou.

The sound mostly is fine organ playing, with a short spoken introduction by Chief Yellow Robe (who played Chetoga, tribe leader)." Written by psteier on IMDb.com.

Warning: Spoilers
"I was greatly impressed by the film's cinematography and direction, especially so under what must have been intensely difficult location shooting conditions. Beautiful scenes of migrating caribou, wolves running at top speed through the snowy forest, bears, and even a wolverine, elevate the diverse wildlife species represented in "The Silent Enemy" to par with the human actors. This Paramount production has an immediacy and a crisp air of authenticity rarely seen in films of the era.

The story line and acting are a different story, and together serve nearly to destroy the viewing experience. Anyone familiar with American Indian history and culture will wince at the one-dimensional stereotypes that almost uniformly obscure any chance of "The Silent Enemy's" helping to inform and enlighten the mass culture and broader audience that Paramount was able to reach. Sadly, the studio took the easy way out, playing to prejudice and racist attitudes of white audiences toward Indians. Some scenes of animal abuse may shock sensitive viewers.

Those glaring faux pas aside, though, this film is not to be missed. Few other titles come to mind that convey the drama and energy of wild nature as this does. The score is well done, and the visuals are full of life." Written by Zinjanthropus on IMDb.com.
