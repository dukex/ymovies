<br />
Reviews:<br />
"Missouri during the Civil War. Yankee captain Clifford and southern cowboy Johs are fighting to win the heart of the blond daughter of rancher Evans. Average spaghetti western with good music by Bruno Nicolai and a great role for Nello Pazzafini as the rebel leader, whereas Peter Lee Lawrence performs rather wooden as the hero Johs, and the story becomes a bit tedious. Especially blondy is so irresolute in her wishes that you wouldn't believe men are fighting to the death for her. Voted 4/10." Written by unbrokenmetal on IMDb.com <br />
