Reviews:<br />
"This right here is a painfully overlooked western that, in my opinion, should be mentioned right along with classic westerns like Once Upon a Time in The West or The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. Though perhaps not quite as good as those films, it's an under-appreciated classic nonetheless. The actors are all very good, especially a very young Jack Nicholson playing his trademark lunatic years before it was his trademark. Though his character has a fairly small role and doesn't show up until over half way through the movie, he is easily the best character involved. The rest of the actors are good as well, and Millie Perkins is one heck of a beautiful woman. The plot, which I wont ruin for you, is very well written and delivers a completely unexpected twist at the very end. The only complaint that I can think of about this film is the pacing. There are moments when it drags pretty badly, but aside from that it's a truly great film that deserves more recognition." Written by Vampenguin on IMDb.com.<br />

Warning: Spoilers<br />
"This movie has been described as an existential Western. For once I can see how that is not a pretentious way of describing a film. Like Johnny Depp's character William Blake from Jim Jarmusch's "Dead Man", we discover that the West was not a nice place to be. Only in "The Shooting" we realise that the past is also a claustrophobic place. From the start we are given first-person camera-shots, we see the dusty cloying ground, we feel wary, not knowing if a bushwhack is coming upon us. The music from Richard Markowitz is a passable pastiche of Penderecki and fully adds to the loneliness and isolation. The most claustrophobic shot is when we are put into a tent with Coley and Willett. Coley is half-crazy in a cabin-fever state, having been awake two days guarding against an unknown killer who has blown his associate's face off. The tent is of wondrous antiquity, and closes in on them. The movie descends into a dance of death, a crazy mass suicide into the middle of the Utah desert.<br />
<br />
The final scene plays out as a scramble up a grey valley covered in dirty gold boulders. Just totally exquisite. Perhaps the best western you'll ever see." Written by oOgiandujaOo_and_Eddy_Merckx on IMDb.com.<br />
