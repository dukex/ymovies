IMDB: The Rogers family are rich and powerful cattle and land owners. The Caine brothers - Ben, Thomas and Eli - rebel against them and steal a shipment of gold coins. The Rogers are used to settling their affairs personally and kill Ben, while the other two manage to escape, although their house is burned down. Maria, Ben's wife, has only one wish: to avenge her husband's death. Only one person will help her to achieve this end: Manuel, a lonely gunfighter who accepts to help her due to his past relationship with Maria and Ben. Manuel decides to kidna*p Diana, the Rogers' beloved daughter, and Maria obliges her father and his three sons to humble themselves on Ben's grave and ask for forgiveness. However, both the Rogers and the Caines' plans for each other go awry... with tragic and deadly results.<br />
<br />
PLOT (Wikipedia): Will Rogers, the despotic patriarch of a wealthy cattle ranching family, forces the sheep farming Caine brothers - Ben, Thomas, and Eli - to sell off their livestock. In retaliation, the Caines steal a shipment of gold coins intended for the Rogers; during their escape, Ben is wounded. Thomas and Eli ride to their ranch, while Ben, upon returning to his home, is ambushed by the Rogers and lynched as his wife, Maria, is forced by Will's sons to watch. The Rogers then ride to Thomas and Eli's ranch and burn down their house. The brothers ride to Maria's home to find her burying her husband, and give her a third-share of the stolen money.<br />
<br />
Driven by revenge, Maria take the money to a ghost town surrounded by dunes, where she meets its lone inhabitant, Manuel. A gunfighter with a fetishistic habit of wearing a black leather glove in duels, Manuel had once shared a romantic relationship with Maria and a friendship with Ben, but he left the pair to marry in order to suppress his violent nature. Maria asks him to avenge Ben on her behalf - although reluctant and sceptical, Manuel accepts her offer.<br />
<br />
Manuel rides to a nearby town and stays at a hotel that Will's sons frequent. In the saloon, vigilantes from the rival Vallee family confront and attack the Rogers brothers in an attempt to run them out of town; Manuel kills the Vallees, and is quickly arrested. The next morning, the Rogers brothers bribe the sheriff into releasing Manuel, and take him to the family ranch. Thankful for saving his sons, Will provides Manuel a job as the ranch's foreman. That night, Manuel dines with the Rogers and their ranch hands, during which he opens a jar of mustard to find a jack-in-the-box, resulting in both dinner tables erupting with laughter as they accept him as their friend.<br />
<br />
Later, Manuel opens the ranch's corral and frees the horses; during the commotion as the Rogers try to pursue their mounts, he ki*dnaps Diana, Will's teenage daughter, and takes her to the ghost town. Thomas and Eli r*ape Diana, while Maria and Manuel, growing increasingly impassioned and uncomfortable with the situation that is transpiring, wait outside in the street. Maria rides to the Rogers ranch and demands that they re-bury Ben in the town cemetery in exchange for Diana's life. They begrudgingly accept, and provide Ben with a sizeable funeral procession and burial. Thomas and Eli, fearing that Maria's revenge scheme will result in disaster, attempt to convince Manuel to surrender Diana to them, but they are forced to leave when he threatens to kill them.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Manuel rides to the ghost town to see the Rogers waiting for him on one side of the street, and he guns them down in quick succession. Diana, on horseback and armed with a rifle, witnesses the duel. Manuel removes his "killing glove", disarms himself and confronts Diana, who shoots him and rides away as he collapses onto the sand and dies.<br />
