Reviews: <br />
"The 'Spaghetti Western' fan's bible, Thomas Weisser's 'The Good, the Bad and the Violent' really gives this film a hard time, even voting it one of the 10 worst spaghetti westerns of all time (No.9 to be exact)... but that's all a bit too harsh. Compared to the efforts of Franco and Ciccio, or any of Demofilo Fidani's other films, or indeed any of Sartana's cheap and trashy ones, this is a pretty solid film.<br />
<br />
And it's good for a laugh.<br />
<br />
Weisser and his cohorts even admit that the film's sequences with Django are pretty funny. As are the scenes with Johnny Ringo and Black Star (called Black 'Stand' in the subtitles of the version I saw). In fact, the scenes parodying Spaghetti Western clichés are extremely stylish and very well done.<br />
<br />
The song and dance numbers, often cut from American prints, are quite bizarre and I think this film would be better served on a double bill with 'Head', the Monkees movie.<br />
<br />
A word of warning, if you watch this movie on the Japanese DVD, then you should turn off the English subtitles if you want to follow the plot, as they don't make any sense...especially in the song lyrics. Or keep them on and get a few extra laughs for your money.<br />
<br />
Overall, I enjoyed this fun movie and it's an alternative to the vile misogyny of Cut-Throats Nine." Written by Poison-River at IMDb.com<br />
