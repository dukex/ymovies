Storyline:<br />
Craig Hill plays Will Flaherty, who returns to Little Tucson after serving three years in prison for a robbery and two killings he didn’t commit.<br />
<br />
He’s escaped from prison, now he’s determined to clear him name. But he has to find Luke Brabham, the man whose testimony got him convicted.<br />
<br />
That same night, a gang of bandits led by Tiny (Eduardo Fajardo) and Doc (Robert Camardiel) ride into Little Tucson looking to hold up the bank. Guess who’s part of their gang? That’s right — Luke Brabham (Piero Lulli).<br />
<br />
But the gang is having a run of bad luck. They blast open the safe only to discover the gold shipment they wanted to steal hasn’t arrived yet.<br />
<br />
So they round up all the residents of Little Tucson and decide to hold them captive until the stage carrying the gold arrives. When the first stage arrives, it’s full of female dancers, not gold.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Will Flaherty might be Little Tucson’s best chance for getting out this mess. But he’s been captured by the bandits, beaten and tied up.<br />
<br />
The only thing keeping him alive — some of the bandits want to know what he did with the $30,000 he was sent to prison for stealing. Written by Mark Franklin on http://onceuponatimeinawestern.com<br />

Reviews:<br />
"Taunt, very well done Spaghetti with a nice score, fine camera work and an intelligent script. Now how often do you find that in a lesser known film?<br />
<br />
The entire first hour of the film takes place in the town, but that doesn’t prevent director Michael Caiano from providing plenty of tension and action.<br />
<br />
Giulia Rubini plays Peggy, the dance hall singer who has been faithful to Will throughout his imprisonment, but wonders why he didn’t fight harder to prove his innocence.<br />
<br />
Eleanor Vargas is Judith, leading of the dance hall troupe that arrives in Little Tucson and walks right into trouble." Written by Mark Franklin on http://onceuponatimeinawestern.com<br />
