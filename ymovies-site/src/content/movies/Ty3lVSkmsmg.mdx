Storyline:
Just when Cjamango has won a bag of gold in a poker game, he is attacked by the gangs of El Tigre and Don Pablo. As he recovers from the injuries caused by the attack, Cjamango becomes attached to a Mexican boy, Manuel, and to a beautiful girl, Perla. El Tigre and Pablo are meanwhile at odds with one another about the gold, and Cjamango tries to play them against themselves. But there is also a mysterious stranger whose aims are unclear.

Reviews:
"Sean Todd (aka Ivan Rassimov) stars in this little known spaghetti western as Cjamango, one of the countless Django-like gunfighters who roamed the Italian west. He's seeking a gold treasure that he won in a poker game which was immediately hijacked by El Tigre and Don Pedro (Pierro Lulli and Lorenzo Livion). Helping him along his way is the mysterious stranger Clint (Mickey Hargitay), an orphan (Giusva), and the beautiful Pearl (Helene Chanel). This one has a higher body count than usual, and among them are some of the good guys. Livion is the guy underneath the pillow in a scene he shares with Lee Van Cleef in that movie, so the film abounds with spaghetti veterans. The music is great, trumpets and guitars, and the final scene is nicely choreographed. One of the best middle-grade Eurowesterns." Written by rockerace on IMDb.com.
