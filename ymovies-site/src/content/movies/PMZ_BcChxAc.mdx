"An angry Philippine nationalist stops the planned rebellion against United States forces during the American occupation in 1902, after seeing the Americans helping his people with food and medicine. This was a joint U.S. and Philippine production shot entirely in the Philippines. John Agar is outstanding in this film. Respectfully yours, Sarge Booker"<br />
