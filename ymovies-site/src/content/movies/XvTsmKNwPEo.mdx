Story:<br />
Good-natured troublemaker "Cyclone" Tom Saunders is hired by a ranchers' association manager to investigate recent cattle rustling at one of their ranches and to see if a pair of nesters have anything to do with it. After discovering the nesters, pretty Betty Powell and her rickety old father, are incapable of rustling, Tom instead turns his attention to the huge, swaggering bully of a foreman, Nate Lenox.<br />
<br />
Review:<br />
"190 Pounds Of Dynamite"<br />
Tom Tyler hired to go after the nesters but goes after the cattle rustlers instead. An unusual role for Charles King in a suit and tie and not getting into any fisticuffs but some good battles between Tyler and Richard Alexander. Tyler from the beginning lives up to his reputation as a trouble maker. Jean Carmen and Earl Dwire have a runaway carriage and a Chinese laundry is wrecked as a result of his antics. A great scene with Justice Hiram McClump (Ralph Lewis) after Tyler is arrested and fight scene staged by Brownell (William Desmond). Pablo (Julian Rivero) and Blinky (Nelson McDowell) do a great job as dual sidekicks with a flair for comic relief. Written by frank4122 on imdb.com<br />
