Synopsis:
After a long battle with Gen. Miguel Sebastian of Mexico, Capt. McKane (Jim Davis) and his troops successfully take over a small town in Southern California. Despite the Mexican settlers' claim that the land is rightfully theirs, McKane, Sgt. Pardee (Lee Van Cleef) and a gang of mercenaries drive them from their homes. When U.S. Judge Ward Young (Louis Jean Heydt) and his lawman son, Faron (Faron Young), come to town, they're shocked by McKane's ruthless leadership and vow to set things right.

Reviews:
Former Cavalry officer Jim Davis and fellow heavies Lee Van Cleef and Marty Robbins take control of a huge parcel of land following the Mexican American War, pushing the Mexican peasant farmers off the property given them by it's former owner, a General in the Mexican Army.

Raiders Of Old California looks a bit cheap but it's so hard-boiled and action packed that the low-budget doesn't hurt it all that much, though I wish country stars Robbins and Faron Young could have strummed and sang a few tunes.

Speaking of Young, he's pretty good as Davis' nemesis, a justice seeking U.S. Marshall. If he had been fifteen years older he could have been an excellent Saturday matinée western star.

Lee Van Cleef too has a pretty meaty role as Davis' number one henchman. Here he's just as mean, cold, and cruel as he is in later performances. This is essential viewing for Van Cleef fans.
