Reviews:
"If you like action-packed westerns, then you'll be in for a treat when you see the marvelous masterpiece, "Blood and Guns." It has a great cast, fantastic acting, and it takes a common "good guys vs. bad guys" plot and turns it into a memorable viewing experience through humor, tragedy, and most importantly, Orson Welles. There has never been a film like this before or after its release. It's a true original! What other movie uses billy goats strapped with dynamite to attract the enemy? What other movie shows Orson Welles shooting at a man on a horse going around a little red car in cirlces? None. There is an evil doctor with a chin bigger than Jay Leno's. There is a great battle scene between the peasants and the mexican brown-suits. Tomas Milian, who played Tomas F. Dobb in a spanish version of "Revolution", is the man with the big black sombrero who taunts Orson Welles until he learns his lesson from the big man himself. There's the naive mexican boy. The frightened citizens. The violence. And Orson Welles, who actuually trips near the end of the film and the director left it in. A classic! It's very hard to find. Get it if you can."

"Great movie The pacing is great, the way that you get to know about Tepepa's morals is very efficient and adds to the overrall suspense as you find yourself wondering weather you should like him or not; That combined with the background theme of the movie, that is the anarchist mexican revolution, really gives the film a iconoclastic feel to it. It might be a bit too long and the dubbing is really bad but the film is worth it anyway for the insight on the mexican revolution as well as the political and yet not preachy or propaganda-like commentary."
