<br />
Storyline:<br />
A gang of landgrabbers, led by Mexican bandit Manuel, terrorizes the small town of Landford City. The sheriff asks the army for help, which orders Captain Mike Jackson to see what is going on in his old home town and also search for a government agent who has disappeared in that area. Jackson immediately finds himself in the middle of fist fights and shoot-outs with the bandits.<br />
<br />
Reviews:<br />
"When Jeff Cameron is at the top of your cast list, you know you’re about to embark on a low-budget ride through Spaghetti land.<br />
<br />
And this one doesn’t disappoint in that sense, with banal dialogue (check out the last quote below), lots of horse riding scenes and lots of bad guys doing acrobatic death spirals after our hero points his gun in their general direction.<br />
<br />
This one does benefit from a larger cast than most, which makes for a slightly more complicated plot.<br />
<br />
Just don’t spend too long thinking about some of the plot twists, like why Mary’s father would reveal the secret location of his mine to a government agent minutes after meeting the man<br />
<br />
The story line also includes a truly imaginative way to do away with the film’s bad girl (Esmeralda Barros as Paquita) so that Jeff doesn’t have to be responsible for gunning down a female.<br />
<br />
That slightly larger than normal cast includes Donal O’Brien as a sneering villain with a penchant for pretty girls, and Krista Nell as Jeff’s former lover, forced into a life of whoredom by the low-lifes who have taken over Landford City."
