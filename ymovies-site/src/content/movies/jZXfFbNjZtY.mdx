Reviews:<br />
"The silence after the last scene remains the basic gift of this just impecable film. The cinematography and the acting, the delicate manner to explore sensitive subjects, a Western about minor characters of the genre, the great contrast between room and outside, the splendid construction of dialogue and tension are the good points of this real special short film about choices, truth, women and children. So, great in all the senses."<br />
