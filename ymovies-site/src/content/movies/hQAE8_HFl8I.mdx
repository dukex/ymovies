Reviews:
"As a teenager growing up in Somalia, my father brought me to see this movie (Wanted) for a treat. It was an open-air cinema, the Southern Cross was above us and as Padre Carmello gave refuge to Gary Ryan, the moon eclipsed. I was torn between looking at the screen and looking at the sky for I didn't want to miss the actions in the movie and the spectacular phenomenon of the eclipse.

I am now in my late forties and my wife purchased the video from Cinecity in Netherlands on the Internet for my birthday. I couldn't believe my luck at being able to see this great movie again.

The only difference is that this time is in English with Greek subtitles when before I watched it in Italian.

In short, Gary Ryan, the new Sheriff of Greenfield falls for a trap and finds himself locked up under false testimony by Cheryl, the woman who owns the biggest hotel in Greenfield. Eventually he finds a way out to struggle against all odds for justice

The other fascinating things about the movie are the names of the locations such as New Face Rock, Devils Cliff etc, inspired by nature.

Here are some impressive lines: "What I think doesn't mean much unfortunately, proof and testimony are the only languages that the law recognizes" by Judge Anderson of Greenfield "Unreasonably risking your neck is against Gods law" by Padre Carmello. "He could be almost anywhere looking for some place to hide, alone hunted by the law and society-Wanted" by Martin Heywood (the Professional Gambler. "Pray your last, coward" by Fred Lloyd.

Exciting story line, beautiful scenery, good camera works, especially the angles and moreover, the score is not short of Ennio Morricone. I would recommend to any Spaghetti fan." Written by aheibe on IMDb.com

"In spite of what my fellow commenter states this is a fabulous Euro Western film by visionary director Giorgio Ferroni, who endows what might be an otherwise routine Oater about organized cattle rustling into a unique genre pastiche. Giuliano Gemma is well suited to the role of the lawman wrongly fingered for a crime he didn't commit seeking justice south of the border amongst the heavily made up extra actors who look about as authentic as Mexican peasants as the Little Rascals would.

What makes the film work is Ferroni's visual prowess, combining sound stage footage with location work (some of which looks like Yugoslavia or maybe France) and a profound grasp of how to use color to make visual compositions that just happen to represent a cowboy movie. This one isn't quite a "Spaghetti Western", with a plot-heavy story rather than the usual posturing and exaggerated artiness of a Leone or Corbucci film. There are very few closeups of people's shoes, and the action sequences are more or less straightforward. The movie existed on the page before being visually realized.

And for that reason I find it interesting; there is a surrealist bent going on here creating realities that are more "real" than a John Ford movie. What the movie may be lacking in terms of authenticity or visual flair is more than compensated for by a deliberate sense of composition. The movie looks like a storyboarded cartoon or graphic novel rather than a sprawling, dusty film epic, and the attention to character & set detail is refreshing.
