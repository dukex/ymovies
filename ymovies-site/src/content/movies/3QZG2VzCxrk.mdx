Three Americans are headed by ship around the cape to the California gold fields when they are put ashore for several weeks in a sleepy little Mexican village. While there, they are offered the job of following a lady deep into the Indian-infested mountains of Mexico to rescue the lady's husband trapped by a cave-in at their gold mine. For the job they are promised $2000 each. While each contemplates their own chances for getting the lady and/or the gold mine, if they can survive to enjoy it.

Reviews:
"Thrilling and evocative, this story, shot in CinemaScope, has great acting, great screenwriting, and great cinematography. Check out a strong leading cast and a good supporting cast. Cooper and Widmark are exceptional, the former playing the virtuous, good-natured cowboy we expect, and the other playing a gambler with an ace up his sleeve-a heart of gold. Susan Hayward is beautiful and enticing both in appearance and in performance. A backup cast of Cameron Mitchell, Rita Moreno, and others does a good job keeping you interested. Henry Hathaway delivers again and you'll ride off into the sunset a satisfied and happy viewer." -Written by "kristiankidd-10033" on IMDb.com
