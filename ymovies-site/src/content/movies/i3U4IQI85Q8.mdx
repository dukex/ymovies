In the coast range mountains on the western edge of the Salinas Valley is a ranch where Tom, a lad of about ten, longs for a pony. He lives with his mom, who was born there, her dad, a talkative pioneer who misses the old West, Tom's dad Fred Tiflin, who comes from the city and after years on the ranch doesn't feel at home there, and Billy, their trusted hand, a real cowboy. While Fred has to sort out whether he wants to stay a rancher and come to terms with his son being closer to Billy than to himself, Tom gets a pony and learns directly about responsibility and loss. What lessons can each learn, and are tragedy and hard choices all that life offers? Are laughter and joy anywhere?<br />
<br />
Reviews:<br />
"Timeless classic based on the novel by John Steinbeck that the whole family can really enjoy.<br />
Sensitive and enjoyable film about a ranch boy who is gifted with a colt . The young Northern California boy cares his colt , enjoys , plays, until the little horse escapes , then things go wrong.<br />
<br />
A family film with emotion , sensibility and good feeling . It manages to accomplish attractive scenes , though slow-moving and dull , at times . Actors are frankly suberb such as Robert Mitchum, Myrna Loy , Shepperd Strudwick , Margaret Hamilton as an angry teacher , the small boy Peter Miles , and special mention for Louis Calhern as the grandfather usually telling stories. It was remade for TV in 1976 directed by Robert Totten with Henry Fonda , Maureen O'Hara , Ben Johnson, Jack Elam.<br />
<br />
It contains a really classy musical score by the great composer Aaron Copland . As well as colorful and brilliant cinematography by excellent cameraman Tony Gaudio, in perfect remastering. The motion picture was competenly directed by Lewis Milestone . This one was a vintage filmmaker who shot a lot of films in all kinds of genres with penchant for warlike genre , getting some masterpieces . As Lewis Milestone directed the following ones : " Mutiny on the Bounty" , "Oceans' 11", "Pork Chop Hill" , "Halls of Moctezuma" , "Arch of Triumph" , "The Strange Love of Martha Ivers" , "Of Mice and Men" , "The General died at Dawn", "The Front Page" , "All Quiet on the The Western Front" , "The Garden of Eden" ."-Written by ma-cortes on IMDb.com<br />
