Reviews:
"At Los Trancos it's Bob Steele's dad versus the Bar A Ranch. Many reliable western actors in this one. Budd Buster was great as a sidekick and for comic relief. Jack Ingram who's ranch was used for many Roy Roger's films. Richard Cramer a mainstay western and Laurel and Hardy heavy. Of course, Charles King is always there when the lead is being thrown. I've never seen Gertrude Messinger or Duke R. Lee but they did well as Steele's love interest and the sheriff respectively."
