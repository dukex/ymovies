Storyline:<br />
The Trinity legend continues when the sons of Trinity and Bambino head out on the road to continue the legendary hijinks of their fathers.<br />
<br />
Reviews:<br />
"Sons Of Trinity was directed in the mid-1990's by the late Enzo Barboni, the same director of the early 1970's Trinity movies 'They Call Me Trinity' and 'Trinity Is Still My Name'<br />
<br />
Sons Of Trinity features the Sons of the original characters of Trinity and Bambino, in yet another comedic spaghetti western. The sons have the same names as their fathers, the same looks, the same personality and mannerisms, the same quirks, etc... It still works quite well and has the same basic elements as in the original movies.<br />
<br />
Shot in Spain and featuring two American actors in the lead roles of Trinity and Bambino, this was in stark contrast to the two leads in the original Trinity films played by Italian actors with fake Americanized names.<br />
<br />
All in all, I enjoyed Sons Of Trinity. It isn't quite as good as the original movies, but it is still quite entertaining!" Written by Katatonia on IMDb.com.<br />

Warning: Spoilers<br />
"Shrewd, but laid-back Trinity (amiable Heath Kizzier) and the burly, hot-tempered Bambino (the equally engaging Keith Neubert) are the sons of a pair of notorious troublemakers. The nice guy drifter duo come to the aid of a peaceful small town that's being terrorized by an evil gang of bandits. Writer/director Enzo Barboni delivers a good-natured comedic outing that unfolds at a steady pace, maintains a disarmingly lightweight tone throughout, and offers plenty of amusingly silly and inoffensive humor (a lively and protracted last reel outburst of rough'n'ready fisticuffs is especially sidesplitting). The likable and relaxed chemistry between appealing leads Kizzier and Neubert really keeps the picture humming. The fetching Yvonne De Bark further enlivens the proceedings with her radiant portrayal of the sweet Bonita. Moreover, there are neat supporting turns by Renato Scarpa as the benign Pablo, Siegfried Rauch as tough horse rancher Parker, Ronald Nitschke as a bald, hard-nosed sheriff, Renato D'Amore as grimy no-count outlaw Ramirez Primero, and Jack Taylor as stuffy rich jerk Theopolis. Both the crisp cinematography by Juan Amoros and the twangy, harmonic score by Stefano Mainetti are up to par. A pleasant diversion." Written by Woodyanders on IMDb.com.<br />
