Reviews:
With Roy Rogers, Dale Evans and Sons Of Pioneers you know the music has to be great and it was. With excellent English actors Elisabeth Rison and Dennis Hoey of Sherlock Holmes fame, the acting was first rate too. Long time character actor, Francis McDonald and well known henchman, Edward Keane turned in solid performances. Of course all time best sidekick Gabby Hayes was in rare form. This time with a very friendly lamb who kept pestering Gabby to no end. The war of the sheepherders versus the cattlemen comes to a head with an ending that won't disappoint. Roll On Texas Moon has to be part of any fan of western movies.
