Story:<br />
A gunslinger rides into the town of Purgatory and tells the townspeople he's the town tamer they've been expecting, knowing full well that he shot the man back in the desert. He agrees to their $500 fee, payable when the job is complete to the widow of another man he killed, and sets about freeing the town from it's wheelchair-bound criminal boss, who hires three killers in succession to rid the town of its new lawman.<br />
<br />
Review:<br />
An odd and interesting western<br />
The false town tamer (James Craig who had killed the real one and takes his place) has to wipe out the town from a crippled saloon owner who seems to hire any gunslinger in the whereabouts. We see Craig killing one by one all those supposed to kill him. Until the last one who happens to be his one kid brother (Brett Halsey)!<br />
An odd little Western in which the four fast guns of the title include Sabin and the three men hired to kill him. Not the fastest pace, but not dull either. It's quite interesting with some nice flourishes such as three fast guns coming to take care of James Craig's false lawman, and one of them generates a twist, the rather bleak look of the town, it's inhabitants and the landscape - there's an air of brutishness prevalent and only the humour by Edgar Buchanan as the deputy lightens things. The most interesting element is Paul Richard's character- a disabled villain who has a penchant for poetry and piano playing. But there's a twisted aura about him, especially when he plays a discordant note when something annoys him. It's an interesting and above average western which can appear boring but it isn't. It reminds me of Terror in a Texas Town, another odd western with that bleakness. Written by coltras35 on imdb.com<br />
