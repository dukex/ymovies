Storyline:<br />
When the multiple murderer Cain is released from prison after 18 years, he wants to settle down as a rancher and never touch a gun again. But his former life haunts him; not only that nobody wants to give him a job, some villains also want to pay him back. So he has to accept the offer of showman Ruffalo to perform as "Killer Cain" in his traveling shooting show. However after 18 years without practice even Ruffalo's young assistant Billy shoots better than Cain.<br />
<br />
Reviews:<br />
"This is a most peculiar western film. Clint Walker plays the role of Cain, a man released from prison after a 20 year sentence. The passing of time is touched on when Cain sees many new inventions such as a bicycle. His reputation seems to follow him everywhere he goes, and he can't hold a job very long. His only choice is to exploit his past evil life, and join a wild western shooting show run by a showman named Ruffalo, played by Vincent Price. I would recommend this film to any film fan that enjoys strange or Avant Garde Films. Price seems to believe that he is in one of his American International (AIP) horror roles like House of Usher or Pit and The Pendelum. The acting plays as if each actor believes they are in a different film. The movie was released by United Artists in 1968. It is not available on VHS or DVD, but it does show up on TV from time to time on Encore Westerns. I believe that MGM owns the United Artist catalog. They should restore this film and release it as part of their Avant Garde cinema series." Written by Tony Rome on IMDb.com.<br />
<br />
"The bottom line is that "MORE DEAD THAN ALIVE" (1969, Sparr) is a really good film. Clint Walker is wonderful as always playing gentle giant Cain, murderous outlaw turned humble man; Vincent Price is great (... of course) as Dan Ruffalo; Anne Francis is very sympathetic as Monica; and Paul Hampton is solid as the annoying and cocky little sharp shooter with much to learn." Written by TCurtis9192 on IMDb.com.<br />

"This is a western with great direction and a very good cast. It's not your run of the mill shoot'em up. I saw this movie many years ago and have not forgotten it. I have searched high and low for it, but, cannot find a copy anywhere. It's worth the watch!" Written by dixiecarson on IMDb.com.<br />
<br />
"Clint Walker fans won't be disappointed, and I love the ending. Vincent Price seems to be having a great time in his role, and although Mike Henry is underused, he does a great job with his small, but important role, playing one of the villains. Hampton looks the part, but tends to overact a little (though not to the extent some have said) and ultimately he does well. I would rather have seen a tougher-looking guy in his role, such as Dean Smith, but it's not that big an issue." Written by Johnboy1221 on IMDb.com.<br />
