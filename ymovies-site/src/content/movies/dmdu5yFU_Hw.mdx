Storyline:<br />
Andrea Balestri has dubbed himself Kid Terror O’Hara, leader of a group of children who head to the ghost town of Torque to play cowboy games.<br />
One day, he overhears a gang of outlaws planning a bank robbery in River City, his hometown. As a game, and as part of an attempt to be taken more seriously by the adults in town, Kid Terror O’Hara decides he and his friends will rob the bank themselves.<br />
In a complex plan that includes diversions, padded wagon wheels, explosives made from gunpowder and butter, and smuggling the smallest child into the bank in a piece of luggage, the children succeed.<br />
They hadn’t counted on the outlaws looking for revenge once they realize someone got to the gold before they did.<br />
Nor had Kid Terror and his friends quite figured out how they would tell the town sheriff what really happened at the bank. <br />
<br />
Reviews:<br />
"Give this film a chance, and you might be pleasantly surprised. I went into it with empty gun expectations and wound up laughing more than at the far majority of the Spaghetti West comedies.<br />
<br />
Some of the humor is crude. Offering the outlaws warm beer, Kid Terror has the child with the weakest bladder slip behind the bar and pee in two mugs.<br />
<br />
But there are some genuinely clever moments — and dialogue — too. These kids have more moxie and ingenuity than they know what to do with.<br />
<br />
There’s also a subplot with lots of familiar faces. A corrupt businessman named Wilson (Franco Ressell) is trying to squeeze farms off their land by not extending a loan to their leader, McKenzie (Attilio Dottesio).<br />
<br />
Fortunato Arena plays the sheriff trying to sort through all the trouble in town." Written by Mark Franklin on onceuponatimeinawestern.com<br />
