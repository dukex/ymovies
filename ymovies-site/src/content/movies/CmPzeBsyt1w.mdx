<br />
Reviews:<br />
"I agree that Klaus Kinski's performance was, as usual, stunning, especially when he attempts to seperate the two men fighting by hitting them and screaming: "I said love!" hehe... Is that a spaghetti western? In its own way, I think it is. The director is Italian. There weren't any fancy editing or haunting score though. Nor a striking character. Nor an amazing performance. The movie is pretty straightforward, almost real. Settling scores. Revenge. The lone and mysterious anti-hero. Gangs. Violence. All-in-all, it was so-so, but not a total waste of time. There were some fun moments. But it was just too...plain. You know what I mean? I bought it for less than a buck, so I didn't lose much." Written by monabassil on IMDb.com  <br />
