Reviews: 
""La taglia è tua... l'uomo l'ammazzo io" (1969), more commonly known as "El Puro", is a Spaghetti Western directed by Edoardo Mulargia. The plot is straightforward: the once infamous gunfighter "El Puro" (played by Robert Woods) is now a drunkard hunted by bandits for the $10,000 reward on his head. This looks to have been cheap to make, with limited interiors which are used quite a lot. But these sets look fairly realistic as they are filthy and grubby which gives in an authentic touch of the West. The camera-work by Antonio L. Ballesteros is mainly devoid of style, apart from a few crash-zooms. The editing is rough and hasty, with more than a few jarring cuts. The direction is more spirited, with a well staged gunfight and an excellently handled climax and manages to make some of the more slower scenes interesting enough at least to watch instead of skipping them and getting to the highlights. The acting is good in places, even if Robert Woods performance as "El Puro" is slightly disappointing after seeing his great role in "Black Jack" (1968), but Mario Brega, Marc Fiorini (as Ashborn Hamilton Jr.) and Maurizio Bonuglia acquit themselves well to there roles as the villains of the picture. All in all, you should enjoy it if you are a fan of the genre." Written by JohnWelles on IMDb.com
