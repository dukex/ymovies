Scalps - The commander of a Texan fort in the Civil War refuses to surrender to the Northerners, and tries to buy the local Indian tribe chief's daughter. The sage man refuses, and the Southerners massacre the tribe and abduct the young squaw anyway. The noble squaw manages to escape, and hides out with a rough rancher, who dislikes Indians, but hates the Southerners more. The odd couple joins forces, and tactics, to exert ultimate vengeance on the men at the fort.<br />

Reviews:<br />
"Not a bad one for Mattei. Released at the same time with White Apache, and according to rumors with more input by Mattei (who apparently directed most of this film) than on White Apache.<br />
<br />
Lots of bad dialogue of course, but that was more or less expected. The music was for certain parts quite good, in the vein of older spaghettis but during other parts awful with more modern (whatever) flavor.<br />
<br />
The film was certainly watchable, much better than, for instance, Zombi 3 which he "Co-directed" when Fulci was away for one or other reason. Mattei also tried here for some parts (usually in vein, though) to create this into a some kind of 'drama' film which was not so successful.<br />
<br />
I have no idea about which version is uncut and which one is not, the version I saw was on Greek video.<br />
<br />
If you find this one somewhere, check it out. It's not that bad as it is rumored to be (depending on your tastes, of course). I enjoyed it anyway."<br />
