Reviews:
"Whether you are a casual viewer of westerns, or a die hard fan of the genre like I am, chances are you'll be underwhelmed by "Reverend Colt". About the only positive things about it are that it looks decent (both with photography and production values) and that it's one of the rare spaghetti westerns to have nudity (though the one scene with nudity is blatantly gratuitous). But the movie is a mess. It's often kind of confusing, taking its time to explain some details to viewers. It also feels kind of flat, with not only with not enough action, but the action there is being quite sub par for the genre. Even the music is forgettable! As for Guy Madison, he doesn't show emotion very well for the most part, and he comes across as not totally likable. It doesn't help that in the second half of the movie, his role essentially becomes a supporting player instead of being a prominent player. And Richard Harrison is pretty much wasted in a somewhat minor role. Feel free to skip this foreign oater." Written by Wizard-8 on IMDb.com 

"First of all, it's really necessary to point out that 'Reverendo Colt' is an Italian made western that came to the big screen when the top time of the genre was falling down. We must remember that almost all the classics had been made in 1971. Just as an example, the outstanding 'Django' directed by Sergio Corbucci was released in 1966 and the unforgettable 'Once Upon a Time in West' in 1968. In fact, the 'seventies' is not the best time to find out good spaghetti westerns. But 'Reverendo Colt' is not so bad. It's a simple but otherwise earnest little story of Miller Colt a gunfighter turned preacher that finds himself in the middle of a fight between two gangs for a would-be treasure. In this uncomfortable situation, Miller Cost is forced to return to his guns in order to defend a group of people ambushed by the outlaws in an abandoned military fort. Guy Madison, a veteran American actor, is Miller Colt; Mr. Madison gives a subdued performance but adequate to his character. Richard Harrison is a brawling and a bit dumb sheriff with almost nothing to do in the movie. Cris Huerta is the only one who gives a little touch of comedy to the story and German Cobos as Fred is the real sidekick of Miller Colt. Not a great movie but considering that 'Reverendo Colt' is a spaghetti western made in the declining years of the seventies, not so bad as it could have been." Written by gazineo-1 on IMDb.com
