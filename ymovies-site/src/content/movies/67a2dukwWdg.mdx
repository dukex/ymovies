<br />
Reviews:<br />
"Songs not so western-sounding; Dale and Roy initially at odds; coastal setting; believable, interesting story with intelligent humor - elements of this film which favorably impressed me, without a "try-too-hard-to-be-different" result. "Apache Rose" is the name of a small boat, skippered by Dale. Oil prospector Roy dislikes Dale's delivery plans for his equipment, but, eventually, they warm up to each other, with disguised Dale actually assisting to apprehend the villainous Reed Calhoun, who operates a casino-boat and covets oil-rich land owned by Dale's suitor - the gambling-indebted Carlos Vega, and his sister from out-of-town, Rosa. Some of the comic relief is aptly provided by the bumbling, years-worn, Roy-admirer, Alkali. After twelve years of pretty-much formulaic Roy Rogers movies - which, by this time numbered around 75 - it's nice to see one which is not quite the same as many of them, but doesn't overdo the uncharacteristic."

<br />
"Apache Rose finds Roy Rogers giving up the cowboy life and becoming an oil wildcatter although he still dresses like a cowboy and rides Trigger. He's on the Pacific shores in this film and in some beach caves finds evidence of oil. Not too hard since it's oozing right up from the ground, wouldn't need a geologist to see this one.<br />
<br />
The oil is on an old Spanish land grant ranchero owned by Russ Vincent who is in some deep debt to gambler George Meeker. He owns the ranchero but in partnership with cousin Donna Martell. She has to be eliminated before Meeker can squeeze Vincent.<br />
<br />
Dale Evans is in this and it would surprise a lot of fans to know that Dale was only in about half of Roy's films. Those are of course the best of the Rogers films, they do have a nice chemistry. On another of their films I said that they were a kind of red state Tracy and Hepburn and that holds true for Apache Rose.<br />
<br />
Character actor Olin Howland had the sidekick role in this one and while he's all right, you do miss Gabby Hayes or Andy Devine.<br />
<br />
Definitely one for fans of Roy and Dale." Written by bkoganbing on IMDb.com <br />
