This causes the friendship between Doc and Pat to cool. The odd relationship between Doc and Billy grows stranger when Doc hides Billy at his girl, Rio's, place after Billy is shot.

User Reviews:<br />
"This famous western deals about the most noted gunslinger of the southwest ,William Bonney, a juvenile tough, a teenager wanted dead or alive throughout the west.This is a fiction story of the strange teen-age desperado known to legend as Billy the Kid.Billy was said to be sympathetic,attractive and favourite with girls,particulars represented by the protagonist(Jack Buetel).He'll confront against Sheriff Pat Garret(Thomas Mitchell) and Doc Holliday(Walter Huston) and is enamored by a wonderful girl(Jane Russell).The film isn't based on real events,it's invented story by the screenwriter Jules Furthman with ironic dialogs and a plot with little sense.Thus isn't appeared Tunstall,Chisum ,nor others personages ,neither deeds (Lincoln county war or getaway from gaol)of the Billy Kid life.It's only notorious character Pat Garret who has an important role and Doc Holliday who didn't have none real relation with him.The picture is produced by RKO(Radio Pictures Inc) and Howard Hughes.Howard Hawks began the filming in 1941 and he shot scenes with the cameraman Lucien Ballard but had complications with Hughes and he took the direction contracting to excellent photographer Gregg Toland(Citizen Kane).However the censorship made him modify numerous takes shots.Finally at last,after a three years delay ,public saw a daring production exactly as it was filmed not a scene cut.The picture would obtain myth as erotic Western.Thus is by Jane Russell,she appears moody,mean, magnificent and terrific,too startling to describe,Russell was an authentic sensation for the epoch,she keeps her best attributes in the bosom.Today all the fuss seem totally wrongly. The film has sensations,thrills,pursuits riders,primitive love,action but is a bit bored." Written by ma-cortes on IMDb.<br />

"The Outlaw tells the story of Billy the kid's supposed friendship (and arguments) with Doc Holliday, his battles with weaselly Pat Garrett, and his romantic entanglement with a big-chested girl who nurses him back to health after being gut-shot by the dastardly sheriff.<br />
<br />
A once scandalous adult western, this is decidedly less scandalous by today's standards. It's notoriety simultaneously launched Jane Russell's career as a sex symbol and hurt her career as an actress.<br />
<br />
The overblown hype surrounding Jane's breasts, the film's reputation for being a vanity project for billionaire Howard Hughes, and the high expectations attached to anything directed by Howard Hawks weighs heavily on ones enjoyment of The Outlaw, but this is essentially just a long 1940's style B-western.When viewed through that prism it's fairly decent, if unspectacular entertainment with good performances by the stars. However, I would venture to say that it would have been better if it weren't two hours long." Written by FightingWesterner on IMDb.<br />
