Storyline:<br />
19th Century figure Joaquin Murietta is a formerly wealthy and respected California landowner. However, he has lost his land, his wife, and everything else he held dear. Embittered and questioning his previous faith in God and man, he joins a disparate group of men hired to convey a wealthy man's wife away from the bandit-ridden countryside to safety in San Francisco. Murietta discovers that the convoy is also carrying a treasure of great material and religious value. He finds himself challenged to decide what he believes, and what he should do, in the face of threats to himself, to the convoy, and to the people of southern California.<br />
<br />
Reviews:<br />
"This early TV movie is very enjoyable, starring Ricardo Montalban as the real life Joaquin Murrieta and it basically fictionalized story of how he was hired by Anthony Caruso to a scorched his wife Ina Balin to San Francisco along with a statue of the holy mother. There is betrayal afoot among the wagon train, and that risks the journey which has enough problems to deal with anyway. Slim Pickens and Earl Holliman give good performances as does Miriam Colon as Balin's maid who isn't as loyal as she seems. Then there's football hero Rosie Grier as a slave owned by Caruso, and he is surprisingly a better actor than you'd expect.<br />
<br />
While the story is obviously fiction, it's a good viewpoint of the days of early California, free from Spain, and basically open to grab from anybody who has the strength to grab it. An early encounter between Montalban and Holliman is quite humorous, with Holliman thinking he's got the better of Montalban but quite wrong. There's plenty of action, lots of thrills, and decent performances. Pickens gets some real material, proving that he is much more than just a comical cowboy. Montalban as usual is filled with charm and romance and humor, and always a joy to watch."<br />
