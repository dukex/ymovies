Reviews:
"I like most all Spaghetti Westerns and love most all the "Zapatista" political ones. I think this is my favorite of the lot, though. It's not a fun movie, but it's just so...fun! Only the best, most critical to the genre, can I watch more than once in a six month period and this one I can watch anytime anyone suggests it.

I'm not going to go into all the ways it's arguably the best because this would be a very, very long review, but it's not lacking in any department. The underlying politics is thick and serious and contemporary to its time. The cast is...did I say fun...not to mention extremely talented actors doing some of their best work. That theme has to be the ear worm from hell, though not unpleasantly so, for an ear worm.

I give this one 10/10.
