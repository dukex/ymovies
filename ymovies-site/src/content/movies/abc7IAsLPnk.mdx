Reviews:
"The Dawn Rider has some great actors and characters actors of the time. An early John Wayne film showed that he was destined to be a star. Dennis Moore who could aptly play a hero or villain in his three-decade-long career, played the latter here to perfection. Reed Howes, a silent-era leading man showed that he transitioned to the talkie period exceptionally well. Stunt man extraordinaire Yakima Canutt mixes it up with the Duke in memorable fashion. All this and beautiful Marion Burns caught in a love triangle make The Dawn Rider a most endearing film."
