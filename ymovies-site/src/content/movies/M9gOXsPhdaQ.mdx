The state intends to compensate the land-owners fairly, but a crooked real-estate promoter complicates things. The ranchers, led by Stony Brooke ('John Wayne' (q)), Tucson Smith ('Ray Corrigan') and Rusty Joslin (Raymond Hatton) fight back against both the law and the crooks.<br />

Reviews:<br />
"Great acting, great directing by George Sherman, and a great story line dealing with eminent domain make New Frontier a great western classic. John Duke Wayne rides like the wind in this Three Mesquiteers series. The sound track by by William Lava was exceptional for the time. The action commences when the New Hope Valley ranchers learn their land has been condemned. From there, Eddy Waller leads the town folk in defending their land. This was the perfect vehicle for Jennifer Jones to start her long career. New Frontier is a wonderful movie the whole family will enjoy." Written by frank4122 on IMDb.com <br />
<br />
"New Hope Valley is celebrating its 50th anniversary, but the celebration is short lived by the arrival of assemblyman Proctor and developer Gilbert, who announce that New Hope Valley is being condemned so that the land can be used for the site of a new dam which will give water to nearby developing communities. This riles the residents who attack the developers while they are on construction. Gilbert, who is stopping at no lengths to see the project completed, is convinced that the residents will listen to Stony, Tucson, and Rusty, so he tells them of their plan of moving to a new piece of land where they will have irrigation and the chance to start anew on their farms. However the Three Mesquiteers learn that this was just a dupe by Gilbert & Proctor since they have no plans to carry water to that new valley, and the three go to confront Gilbert and his men before they flood New Hope Valley. Another well done entry in the 3 Mesquiteers series despite the fact that the villainous element isn't seen until 30 minutes into the picture and there is very little in the ways of action until the very end. Like their next film Wyoming Outlaw, this is another entry in the series dealing with issues of the times primarily the leaving of the town versus the use of progress to help nearby communities. Well done with an excellent finale at the dam. Rating, based on B westerns, 7." Written by Mike-764 on IMDb.com <br />
