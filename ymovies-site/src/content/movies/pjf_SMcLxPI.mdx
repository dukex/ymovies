Story:<br />
In 1876, during the Great Sioux Wars, U.S. Cavalry Capt. Phillip Donlin serves at Fort Abraham Lincoln in the Montana Territory. His duties take him away from his wife, Celie Donlin, who feels neglected and unhappy. She is having an affair with Lt. John Haywood, whom she tries to persuade to resign the army and run away with her. Unknown to them, her husband overhears their conversation and confronts them. Heartbroken, he leaves the next morning on another patrol. His latest mission is to arrive at Camp Yellowstone and warn General Custer and his meager forces, numbering a few hundred men, of the large buildup of Sioux forces gathering at the Little Big Horn River. During a stop at a watering hole, Capt. Donlin's patrol is reached by Lt. Haywood's unit and told to return to Fort Lincoln, but the captain disregards the orders and decides to attempt to warn General Custer, whose forces had already left for Little Big Horn River.<br />

Review:<br />
Great Low-Budget Western<br />
Ever watch a movie that was so good you wished it would never end? That's the feeling when watching "Little Big Horn", an unheralded, unheard of (at least by me),old fashioned, Cowboys-and-Indians movie that Hollywood used to turn out by the Conestoga wagon-full. But this one is more suspenseful and well-acted, the characters more developed and the storyline just plain better than most oaters. This is a western with an edge.<br />
<br />
Others have outlined the plot in reviews above, but rarely did LLoyd Bridges, John Ireland and Marie Windsor (the quintessential femme fatale in a cameo) get roles they could sink their teeth into as those found in "Little Big Horn". The realistic atmosphere here rivals that found in some of Hollywood's greatest achievements, for example "Treasure of The Sierra Madre" or "Paths of Glory", made on much bigger budgets. If you are a fan of Hollywood movies, when movies were movies, try not to miss this one. It's available on Amazon now and it's a bargain. Written by GManfred on imdb.com<br />
