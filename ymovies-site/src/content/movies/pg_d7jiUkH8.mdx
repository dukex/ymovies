When the stagecoach in which they travel is attacked by Monteiro's gang, Lash accepts to kill his friend to save his bacon. On reaching his destination - a village near the Mexican border where he is to take possession of a gold mine, he realizes that he has a neighbor, old Johnny, who owns a farm and another gold mine. He immediately sets about making his life miserable, hoping to drive him from the country and lay hands on his possessions. Lash soon becomes the undisputed master of the area, at least until Buckaroo, a wild horse tamer, arrives in town.The young man accepts to work for Johnny and, when his boss is killed in an ambush, starts gathering men with a view to fighting back Lash's army, reinforced by Monteiro and his men, who have resurfaced. After many adventures, Buckaroo gets rid of both Monteiro and Lash, in whom he has recognized the cowardly murderer of his own father.<br />

Reviews:<br />
"The mysterious stranger Buccaroo (Dean Reed) rides into the small gold-digger's nest New Tuscosa, only to discover that the town is dominated by the multiple mine owner Lash (great Livio Lorenzon). As you know from countless westerns, he has gotten the biggest part of his property by forcing the former mine owners into a cheap sale. The only opponent of Lash is the aging gold digger Johnny McKenzie (Ugo Sasso), who strictly refuses to give away his mine under price. But all by himself he is practically in a lost position. Help comes his way in the person of Buccaroo, who condemns Lash's bad methods and dares to stand up against his ruthless thugs. He gets support by Jean Louis, among others, who you probably know best from Barboni's Four Fists for a Hallelujah. Will they be able to withstand the pressure of the villian and what secret does Buccaroo carry inside? With Dino Strano and Gilberto Galimberti there are other well-known faces of the genre in smaller supporting roles, while Monika Brugger (Annie) and Angela De Leo provide the female charms of the film.<br />
<br />
Adelchi Bianchi's (not to be confused with Andrea Bianchi) Buckaroo - Il winchester che non perdona is solid Italo-Western material and knows how to entertain, although something more could have been made of the story. Dean Read plays his role as usual with his tongue in his cheeks and even gets to smash a few (terribly inappropriate) songs (among others "For tomorrow I may die"). Livio Lorenzon once again convinces as a nasty villain and the rest of the line-up does a good job, too. The musical background of Lallo Gori is fine, although I think I know some of the songs from various Fidani epics. All in all, Buccaroo - Gallows Birds doesn't offer any decent entertainment, yet without standing out from the broad, at best elevated, midfield of the genre.<br />
<br />
The movie is rather mediocre, but can entertain adequately, has been well directed and the actors also know how to convince. Fans and collectors should strike, as this is an absolute rarity, which is now available on DVD for the first time worldwide!" Written by BluntWolf on letterboxd.com<br />
