Full Western Movie, Full Length Cowboy Film, English: Ringo, the Mark of Vengeance AKA Ringo, Face of Revenge AKA Los cuatro salvajes (original title): Two adventurers save the life of a man who has a tattooed treasure map on his back. The second needed map is on the back of a sheriff. The hunt begins.

Director: Mario Caiano
Writers: Mario Caiano, Eduardo Manzanos (screenplay)
Stars: Anthony Steffen, Frank Wolff, Eduardo Fajardo

Two vagabonds save the life of a Mexican and discover he has a tattooed map on his back. A second treasure map (tattooed on another man's back) is needed to find the gold. The three are joined by a mean, lean cardsharp, who has been eavesdropping on them and also wants a slice of the cake. A fair adventure movie with a good cast (Fajardo steals the show in a rare positive role as a comical sidekick) but the narrative is a bit of a grab bag. The film also features one of the most melodramatic death scenes you'll ever see in a spaghetti western.
