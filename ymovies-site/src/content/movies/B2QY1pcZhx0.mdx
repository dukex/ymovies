Synopsis:
When, after serving a three-year sentence, Ben Bellow is released from prison, Charlie Logan is waiting for him. Not to hug him. Not to welcome him. Just to let him know, a bit bluntly for sure, that he does not want to hear from him again. His wish will not be granted as the the two sworn enemies constantly reconnect, rob a bank together and go through a million adventures while hating each other's guts...

Reviews:
"Giuliano Gemma and George Eastman together? In a buddy picture?! Co-written by Eastman and Sergio Donati?!?! Sign. Me. Up.

Gemma (Ben) and Eastman (Charlie) play old associates who can't stand one another. Or, more accurately, Charlie can't stand Ben, to such a degree that he waits three days for Ben to get out of prison just so he can tell him so, and then kick his ass. (Yeah, Charlie protests too much.)

A whole lot of stuff happens — they split up, run into one another, Ben robs a bank and sprints into the street screaming for Charlie, they split up, then run into one another again and lose their clothes, etc, etc, etc — but the real joy in the movie is in simply watching Gemma and Eastman interact. As Ben, Gemma is at his most disarmingly wide-eyed and sincere, all eager affection and cheerful engagement, while Eastman's Charlie is irritable, resentful and, occasionally, violent.

But Charlie loves Ben in spite of himself, and during the film's third act, when the threats the pair face get serious, Eastman grants Charlie the kind of pathos his characters rarely possess. It's genuinely touching to watch Charlie worry, and to see the two of them try to say goodbye.

I love it with my entire soul. I am so happy."
