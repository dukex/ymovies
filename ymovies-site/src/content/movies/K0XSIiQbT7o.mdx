Reviews:<br />
"After unknowingly buying stolen cattle from an acquaintance, Giuliano Gemma is forced to kill their hot-headed owner in self-defense. Pursued by bounty hunters, he hunts down the cattle rustler in order to prove his innocence. Along the way, he finds a rape victim staked to the ground and himself at odds with yet another powerful foe.<br />
<br />
An early western role for Giuliano Gemma, this borrows ever so slightly from the Kirk Douglas vehicle Last Train From Gun Hill, with it's spoiled rich-boy-gone-bad villain and is in turn is borrowed upon by Hang 'Em High, a few years later.<br />
<br />
This is pretty unsophisticated and not one of Gemma's best, though it's entertaining enough and competently made, with a straight-forward story and some good Spanish scenery, although the petty townspeople that seem to populate the movie are just too much!<br />
<br />
With his good looks, charisma and way with action, it's easy to see why Gemma went on to bigger things in Europe, even if he's only known as a cult star elsewhere." Written by FightingWesterner on IMDb.com <br />
<br />
"I watch a lot of spaghetti westerns, and "Adiós Gringo" is one of the best I have seen for quite some time. It wastes no time getting to business; the dire situation for the hero is set up in the movie's first six minutes! And the remaining eighty seven or so minutes are extremely captivating. This spaghetti western has a particular hard edge, from the many killings, fist fights, and the humiliation and ordeal the movie's leading female character is forced to go through. Also, the movie really puts the pressure on the hero, making his list of problems increase as the movie progresses from one scene to another. I was frequently wondering if the hero would ever clear his name! The action sequences, though a bit sporadic, are very well done - you really feel the punches and the bullet wounds. The icing on the cake is a nice musical score. If there is any problem with the movie, it would have to be the title - why it is in Spanish when the movie takes place in the United States and with no Mexicans around is a mystery. But that's a minor quibble. Check this movie out!" Written by Wizard-8 on IMDb.com<br />
