Storyline:
When Sheriff Jake sees a man at the safe and then finds the payroll gone, he trails him. Just as he is about to arrest him, the man saves his life. Still suspicious, he joins up with the man and later they learn that Melgrove, the towns leading citizen, is trying to take over the area's ranches by having his gang stop all incoming supply wagons. With the ranchers about to sell to Melgrove, the two newcomers say they will bring in provisions.

Reviews:
"Mystery man John Wayne assists Sheriff George (pre-Gabby) Hayes in his search for polka-dot bandit Yakima Canutt and in the course of the investigation, uncovers a plot by a crooked mining company to steal land from innocent property owners.

Blue Steel is quite possibly the best film Wayne made during his tenure as a Lone Star/Monogram Pictures contract star, helped along by some great camera work, editing, and excellent use of locations, as well as some nice work by legendary stuntman Canutt. The special effect at the film's climax is also pretty good for a poverty row production."
